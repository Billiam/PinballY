ChakraCore is Microsoft's open-source (MIT License) Javascript engine.
It's incorporated into PinballY as a scripting engine for user
customizations.

Embedding ChakraCore into a third-party C++/Win32 application has a
pretty small set of dependencies.  You just need the DLL, the import
.lib for the DLL, and a few header files.  The ChakraCore team even
provides a NuGet package (Microsoft.ChakraCore.vc140) with this set of
files, so in principle the dependencies could be automated via NuGet.
Unfortunately, my version of Visual Studio doesn't seem to be able to
handle this particular NuGet package; it always crashes trying to
install it.  So I've gone a different route, which is a little less
automated but still leaves us with a simple portable project tree:

1. Get the source tree for the current release from
   https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/releases

2. Unpack it into a folder on your hard drive

3. Open ChakraCore-master/build/Chakra.Core.sln in Visual Studio

4. Build the x86 and x64 versions

   a. Select configuration Release/x64
   b. Build -> Build Project
   c. Select configuration Release/x86
   d. Build -> Build Project

5. In a CMD prompt, CD to the PinballY folder and run 
   import-chakra-core.bat <path to ChakraCore-master>

This will copy the required dependency files from the ChakraCore
source tree into the PinballY source tree, where they'll be part of
the PinballY git repository.  

This arrangement is good because it means that you don't have to
install the ChakraCore source tree just to build PinballY.  All
dependent files are captured in the PinballY git repos.  The only
drawback is that any time we want to update to a newer release of
ChakraCore, you have to repeat the manual procedure above.  And even
that isn't so terrible, as the build process for ChakraCore is really
simple, as you can see from the steps above.
