As with libvlc, our git repository includes the binary files from
FFMPEG that we distribute.  We include these to ensure consistent
results from independent builds made from the same git commit.

Our repos includes ONLY the files that we need for our binary
distribution.  We don't include everything because doing so is
unnecessary and wasteful; the full FFMPEG distro is quite large.  It's
not necessary to include everything because nothing in our version is
customized - it's just a snapshot taken from the plain vanilla
end-user FFMPEG distro.  It's more efficient to let users who want the
full installation download the official version from the FFMPEG site.

As with libvlc, we don't need to update our FFMPEG snapshot in lock
step with the FFMPEG release schedule.  It's fine to stick with a
static snapshot for a while.  But updating should be painless in most
cases, since our dependency on FFMPEG is extremely simple -t we just
launch it as an EXE with some command-line parameters.  Given the way
we use it, it's unlikely that we'll run into any incompatible changes
for quite a while.  Keeping relatively up-to-date is always good so
that we benefit from the latest bug fixes and improvements.

The procedure for updating is:

- Download the latest FFMPEG end-user distribution

- Copy the required files from the new FFMPEG distro to your
  PinballY source tree, using the current source tree file set
  as a guide to which files are required
