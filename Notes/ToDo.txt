- Batch media capture - start a media capture process and run it for
all tables, or some selectable subset of tables.

- *IF* people get stuck looking for a dialog box where you type in the
window layout numbers, and don't immediately recognize that you
position the windows the "normal" way, add a tip popup that appears
the first time you run (when Settings.txt doesn't exist yet)
explaining this, and maybe with a couple of other tips, like
right-click -> Options for settings, right-click -> Full Screen for
full screen toggle.

- Default videos: create some attractive default videos for the
various windows (playfield, backglass, DMD, topper).  Ideally create a
few different themes for people to choose from.

- Read and use PinballX\Databases\Statistics.ini?  This contains the
PBX play time/count information.  It might be nice for migration
purposes to read this and use it for tables that aren't already in our
database, so that the play statistics from PBX are carried over.
