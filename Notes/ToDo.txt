- Alternative high score display styles: There's already a "High Score
Style" setting in the game setup menu in anticipation of this, but it
currently only offers a "DMD" style.  Add more options: "Alpha"
(16-segment alphanumeric, for 1980s machines like Funhouse and
Whirlwind), "TT" (typewriter font, for EM machines, to simulate a
typed paper high score card), "Hand" (handwritten font, for EM
machines, to simulate a hand-written paper high score card).  For the
alphanumeric style, find or make a good set of photos of the System 11
display with each character, but adjust it to use alpha so that we can
superimpose it over a background using the VPM DMD color.  When the
style is "Auto", infer the style based on metadata: Alpha for ((type
== SS && year < 1991 || title is in (Funhouse, Harley-Davidson, The
Machine: Bride of Pin-Bot), TT for (type == EM or type == ME), and DMD
for everything else.

- *IF* people get stuck looking for a dialog box where you type in the
window layout numbers, and don't immediately recognize that you
position the windows the "normal" way, add a tip popup that appears
the first time you run (when Settings.txt doesn't exist yet)
explaining this, and maybe with a couple of other tips, like
right-click -> Options for settings, right-click -> Full Screen for
full screen toggle.

- Default videos: create some attractive default videos for the
various windows (playfield, backglass, DMD, topper).  Ideally create a
few different themes for people to choose from.

- Read and use PinballX\Databases\Statistics.ini?  This contains the
PBX play time/count information.  It might be nice for migration
purposes to read this and use it for tables that aren't already in our
database, so that the play statistics from PBX are carried over.
