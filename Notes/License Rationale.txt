Rationale for the choice of open-source license
-----------------------------------------------

This project is currently licensed under GPL v3.

The primary reason is practical necessity: I'm incorporating portions
of VLC, which is distributed under GPL.  Anything that incorporates
GPLv2 code is required by GPLv2 to be itself released under GPLv2-or-
later, therefore incorporating the GPL'd VLC means we have to release
under GPL.

This might actually be an overly conservative reading of the
situation.  To be more precise, we actually only incorporate libvlc
(the core library portion of VLC), and that's nominally licensed under
LGPL - *mostly*.  The problem is that little caveat about *mostly*.
libvlc uses a large number of plug-in modules, and the VLC
documentation states vaguely that "some modules" are under GPL rather
than LGPL.  From what I can tell, there's no such thing as an
LGPL-only release of the libvlc, there's no defined procedure for
building one from source, and there's not even an accounting anywhere
of which modules are LGPL and which are GPL.  All of the actual
distributions of VLC that I can find come with GPL license terms only.

I'd consider changing to a more permissive license, if we can figure
out the libvlc issues.  If someone wants to figure out how to create a
clean LGPL build of libvlc that we can release with the project, I'd
happily change the overall project license to perhaps the Apache
license or a Creative Commons license.
