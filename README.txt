Welcome to PinballY!

PinballY is a "front end" menu system/game selector for virtual
pinball cabinets.  A front end is a program that displays an
arcade-style interface for scrolling through your virtual tables and
selecting the one you'd like to play next.  It makes your cab
friendlier and gives it more of an arcade feel by hiding the Windows
desktop, and allowing you to access all functions through the basic
set of pin cab buttons.

Installing PinballY should just be a matter of unzipping it into a
folder on your hard disk.  The default settings should be suitable for
most systems, but you can customize settings by right-clicking in the
main window and selecting Options from the menu.  There's also a
human-readable settings file that you can edit if you prefer.

PinballY is a free, open-source program.  See License.txt for
copyright and license details.
