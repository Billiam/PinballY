PinballY Update History

08-03-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 5)

64-bit build, to better support 4K video (libvlc needs about 600MB to
play back one 4K video); change memory management for video player to
ensure D3D11 resources are always allocated and released on the main
UI thread.

08-02-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 4)

Fix slight UI pause when generating alphanumeric high score images;
ensure video player D3D11 resources are released on main thread, to
avoid any driver-dependent threading issues with resource deletion;
create game database folders automatically as needed.

07-31-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 3)

Added alternative high score display formats: alphanumeric 16-segment
display style (for 1980s solid-state machines with segmented
displays); typewriter style (for EM machines).

07-27-2018a (1.0.0 Alpha 2)

Bug fix: the program could get stuck on startup searching for
PinballX, if PinballX wasn't installed.

07-27-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 1)
