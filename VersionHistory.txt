PinballY Update History

08-18-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 12)

* Tweaked ffmpeg parameters per STV's findings to try to get 4K
capture working

* Fix error message logging and process exit code recognition in ffmpeg launch

* Switch to 64-bit ffmpeg in 64-bit release bundle

* Update libvlc 32-bit to 3.0.3

* Clear media on real DMD during game play (restores previous behavior
broken in alpha 11)


08-17-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 11)

* If a real DMD is active, close our connection to it whenever we
launch a game, to avoid contention with the game for access to the
device.  (Exception: we don't do this when using dmd-extensions in
virtual mode, due to a problem in the DLL that crashes the process in
this situation.)

08-16-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 10)

* Changed the Auto Launch feature to use Windows Task Scheduler logon
tasks instead of the Run registry key.  The registry key didn't work
with Admin mode launches, and didn't seem reliable on some machines
even for regular user mode launches, especially with the 64-bit
version.  Task Scheduler is the more officially supported way to do
these sorts of launches, so it should be reliable for all cases.


08-13-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 9)

* Added the table type (Solid State, Electromechanical, Mechanical) to
the "Information" display box

* Added support for manufacturer and system logos.  Place PNG logo
files in <media path>\Company Logos and <media path>\System Logos.
For the manufacturers, the files are matched based on the company
name in the game database, but you can also create different logos
for different eras by using this format for the file names:
Gottlieb (1971-1982).png.  For games where the release year is
known, PinballY will try to match a logo for the era containing
that year.  For systems, the system name as defined in the options
is matched.  Systems will also be matched by prefix when there's
no exact match, so the file "Visual Pinball.png" will match 
systems "Visual Pinball 9.2", "Visual Pinball X", etc.  This
lets you create different logos for different system versions
if you like, but also lets you use a common logo for all
versions, as long as you follow the naming convention of placing
the version at the end of the system name.


08-11-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 8)

* Change the minimum video card "shader model" required to shader
model 4 (from 4.1), for compatibility with older video cards.  (The
shader model is basically a Microsoft-defined API that has to be
implemented in the video card hardware and/or device drivers, so
higher shader models generally require newer or more powerful video
cards.  My goal is to be compatible with anything that can run Windows
7 SP1 and Direct3D 11, but it's not quite that simple because the
shader model is an additional dimension of system requirements that
depends entirely on the video card, regardless of how up-to-date your
Windows and D3D software are.)

* Use the correct auto-launching registry key for 64-bit builds.
32- and 64-bit programs are auto-launched with different registry keys:
64-bit: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
32-bit: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

08-10-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 7)

* Added several new logging options, to get (lots) more detail about
various operations.  See the new Log File page in the options dialog.
Some of the new options add a lot of extra information to the log
file, so it's best to keep them disabled unless you're trying to
debug something in that particular area.

* Look for dmddevice.dll in the PinballY program folder first, then in
the VPinMAME folder.  This allows using a specific version of the DLL
with PinballY, without affecting what VPM uses, simply by copying the
desired DLL into the PinballY install folder.

* Detect the dmd-extensions version of dmdevice.dll, and check if its
"virtual" device (the fake on-screen DMD window) is enabled.  If so,
suppress loading the DLL unless the config setting for RealDMD is
explicitly ON; skip it on AUTO.

* Detect the dmd-extensions version of dmddevice.dll and work around
a crash bug in the DLL if we identify it.  (I found the problem in
the DLL and sent a pull request to freezy with the fix, but that will
take a while to propagate around, so for the time being we have to
deal with the existing buggy version of the DLL.)  If you ran into
a problem in the past where PinballY (a) showed a second DMD window 
on the screen that was stuck on top, and (b) tended to crash the
first time you switched to a different game in the wheel UI, this
should fix it.


08-07-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 6)

* Added media file viewer: select via the Game Setup menu; shows
all media folders for the game and all matching files; commands to
open folders in Windows Explorer and delete individual media files

* Added Table Audio media type support, including capture

* Remember dialog window positions, and set the initial default
position so that it's over a non-rotated window
 
* Add media file name template to game info box

* Add option to suppress splash screen at startup

* Fix extra separator bar in "last played" filter menu

* Added a "watchdog" process that restores the desktop taskbar to
visibility, if PinballY happens to crash or otherwise exit abnormally
while the taskbar was hidden for a game launch

08-03-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 5)

64-bit build, to better support 4K video (libvlc needs about 600MB to
play back one 4K video); change memory management for video player to
ensure D3D11 resources are always allocated and released on the main
UI thread.

08-02-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 4)

Fix slight UI pause when generating alphanumeric high score images;
ensure video player D3D11 resources are released on main thread, to
avoid any driver-dependent threading issues with resource deletion;
create game database folders automatically as needed.

07-31-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 3)

Added alternative high score display formats: alphanumeric 16-segment
display style (for 1980s solid-state machines with segmented
displays); typewriter style (for EM machines).

07-27-2018a (1.0.0 Alpha 2)

Bug fix: the program could get stuck on startup searching for
PinballX, if PinballX wasn't installed.

07-27-2018 (1.0.0 Alpha 1)

Inaugural release
