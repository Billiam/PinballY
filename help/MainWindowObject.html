<h1>mainWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   mainWindow is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the main user
   interface window (the "playfield" window).  This window is the event target
   for most UI-related events.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
   <b>keydown:</b> This keyboard event fires when a keyboard key is pressed,
    and is then repeated each time Windows sends an "auto repeat" event
    while the key is being held down.
</p>

<p>
   <b>keyup:</b> This keyboard event fires when a keyboard key is released.
