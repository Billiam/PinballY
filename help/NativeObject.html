<h1>NativeObject objects</h1>

<p>
   This is a Javascript object type that represents a native data
   value, for use with the <a href="DllImport.html">DLL importer</a>
   system.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript's type system is very abstract compared to languages
   like C or C++, which directly expose the primitive datatypes that
   the computer's CPU works with.  The DLL importer provides
   automatic type conversions for many types of DLL calls, but
   in some cases, calling a native DLL function requires working
   with the low-level types that the DLL uses.  NativeObject is
   a way of getting directly to those native types.
</p>
<p>
   A NativeObject isn't itself a native data value:  it's a
   Javascipt object that <i>contains</i> a native data value.
   That means that your Javascript code interacts with a
   NativeObject value <i>like an object</i>.
</p>
<p>
   To illustrate, suppose we have a Javascript variable 'i'
   that contains a NativeObject.  (We'll see how to create
   one of these in a moment.)  You can use 'i' just like an other
   Javascript object, by accessing its "." properties.
   The actual native value is contained in a hidden
   variable inside that object.
</p>
<img class="example" src="NativeObject illustration.png">
<p>
   The tricky part is that you can only indirectly get to the
   real native value contained in the object, for the exact reason
   that this class exists in the first place: namely, that
   Javascript doesn't have any direct way to represent most
   native types.  For example, suppose the native value is
   a 32-bit unsigned integer value.  Javascript doesn't have
   its own 32-bit unsigned integer type; the closest thing it
   has is the Number type.  So when you want to work with the
   native value contained in the NativeObject, the object has
   to convert the value between the native integer type and
   the Javascript Number type.  For the basic integer types,
   this is straightforward, because Javascript's Number type
   is capable of exactly representing any value you can store
   in an 8-, 16-, or 32-bit integer.  But you should keep in
   mind that operations you perform on the value in the
   Javascript domain will always be done in terms of Javascript
   types; the native representation is only used for the
   hidden value stored inside the object.
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
   You create a native object using dllImport.create(), giving
   it a native C type name as the argument, in string format:
</p>
<div class="code">
let i = dllImport.create("int");          // a native 32-bit signed integer
let arr = dllImport.create("short[10]");  // an array of 10 16-bit integers
let s = dllImport.create("struct Foo");   // a structure type, defined elsewhere
</div>

<p>
   Primitive types like int and short are pre-defined.  You can define
   any struct types you need using <a href="DllImport.html#dllImportDefine">dllImport.define()</a>.
   For more detail on the DLL importer and how the C type declarations
   work, see <a href="DllImport.html">Calling Native DLLs</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Initialization:</b>  All bytes of the native data object are
   initially set to zero when the object is created.
</p>
<p>
   In addition,
   if the type is a C struct type, and the struct has a member named exactly
   <b>cbSize</b> and declared as a 16-, 32-, or 64-bit integer type, that field
   is set to the size in bytes of the  struct type.  If any nested struct
   type has a <b>cbSize</b> member, that's also initialized to the size
   of the main struct (<i>not</i> the size of the nested struct).  This is
   a convenience for Windows API calls.  It's extremely common in the
   Windows APIs for struct arguments to include cbSize fields, which the
   caller is required to initialize to the struct size before calling the API.
   Windows uses the cbSize field as a sanity check and
   struct version indicator.  The automatic initialization is just meant
   to save you a little manual code for this common case.  If the automatic
   initialization is problematic for any given struct, you can either
   explicitly assign a different value after creating the object, or
   you can avoid the auto assignment in the first place by changing the
   member name in the struct definition to anything other than cbSize
   in the call to dllImport.define().
</p>
   

<h2>Native object types</h2>

<p>
   There are three basic kinds of native objects:  scalars, structs,
   and arrays.  Each type has slightly different syntax for accessing
   the underlying native values.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Scalars:</b>  A scalar native object is one that contains
   a single value, such as an integer, a HANDLE value, etc.
</p>
<p>
   To access the internal native data value, you use the <b>.value</b>
   property.  This property is actually a getter/setter, so each time
   you invoke it, it accesses the hidden internal native value.  When
   you use .value to read the value, the native value is converted to
   the corresponding Javascript type, and the Javascript value is
   returned:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the native value is an integer type, float, or double,
      the value returned is a Javascript number representing the
      same numeric value.

   <li>If the native type is HANDLE,  a <a href="HandleObject.html">HANDLE</a>
      object is returned.

   <li>If it's a pointer type, a <a href="NativePointer.html">NativePointer</a>
      object is returned

   <li>If the native type is some kind of string (LPSTR, LPCWSTR, etc),
      it's handled like a pointer to the underlying character type,
      so a NativePointer is returned just like for any other pointer type.
      You can use <a href="NativePointer.html#toString">.toString()</a>
      or <a href="NativePointer.html#toStringZ">.toStringZ()</a> on
      that pointer value to translate the character array that the pointer
      points to into a Javascript string.
</ul>
<div class="code">
let i = dllImport.create("int");
i.value = 700;
</div>

<p>
   When you assign a value to the .value property, it invokes the
   setter method, which converts the Javascript value to the
   native value of the type, and stores the result in the internal
   native value memory. 
</p>

<p>
   The tricky part here is understanding the difference between
   the Javascript variable 'i' and the native value itself.  You
   always have to keep in mind that 'i' contains an object, and
   the object contains the native value.  So consider the difference
   between these two statements:
</p>
<div class="code">
i.value = 700;
i = 800;
</div>
<p>
   The first statement updates the native value stored inside
   the object that 'i' refers to.  The second statement changes
   the variable 'i' itself, <i>with no effect on the native
   value</i>.  The native value inside the object will still
   be 700 after the second statement finishes.  But 'i' will
   no longer refer to the native object, since it now just
   contains the Number value 800.
</p>
<p>
   Another interesting implication is that you can have two or
   more Javascript variables that point to the same native
   value.  Consider:
</p>
<div class="code">
let i = dllImport.create("int");
let j = i;

i.value = 123;
j.value = 456;
message(i.value);
</div>

<p>
   If you guessed that the message will be "456", you guessed
   right!  Both variables 'i' and 'j' refer to the same native
   value object.  There's only one native "int" value here, even
   though we have two variables referring to it.  Changing
   i.value will therefore affect j.value, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Arrays:</b>  For array types, you use the normal Javascript
   <b>[<i>index</i>]</b> syntax to access the elements of the array,
   and .length to get the number of elements in the array.  This
   makes it act much like a regular Javascript array.
</p>
<div class="code">
let arr = dllImport.create("int[5]");
for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; ++i)
   arr[i] = i*100;
</div>

<p>
   Note that even though this object looks superficially
   like a regular Javascript array, it's not a true array.   It's
   only a a pseudo-array - an object pretending to be an array
   by defining properties for .length, [0], [1], etc.  If you
   try to use this object in a context requiring a real array,
   it might not work properly, because it doesn't have the
   full set of Javascript Array prototype methods (slice(),
   concat(), indexOf(), etc).  And of course Array.isArray()
   will expose it for the fraud it is.
</p>
<p>
   Unlike real Javascript arrays, <b>you can't add more slots</b> to
   a native array with push(), unshift(), or by assignment.  There's
   a bit of a gotcha here: if you assign an element beyond the
   end of the native array, there will be no error, but it
   also won't change the size of the underlying native array.
   Consider:
</p>
<div class="code">
let a = dllImport.define("int[5]");
a[10] = 777;
</div>
<p>
   That <i>doesn't</i> extend the native array out to
   11 elements (remember, arrays start at index 0, so 
   index 10 refers to the 11th element).  The native array is
   still just 5 elements: that's how you declared it, and that's
   how it will forever remain, because native array types are
   of fixed size.  What the heck does this assignment do, then?  It
   creates a property of the Javascript object with name "10"
   and value 777.  So this is perfectly fine, and you can use it
   to store as many additional properties as you like on the
   Javascript object, but
   it won't have any effect on the underlying native array.
   When you pass the native array to a DLL function, the DLL
   will still just see 5 elements, and won't have any way to
   get at any extra Javascript properties.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Structs:</b>  For struct or union types, you use the usual
   Javascript "object.property" syntax to access the struct elements.
   There's no .value property in this case; instead, you use the
   property names that are defined for the C struct type.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("struct foo { int i; long l; double d; }");
let foo = dllImport.create("struct foo");
foo.i = 1;
foo.l = 1000;
foo.d = 123.456;
</div>

<h3>Integer overflows</h3>

<p>
   The Javascript Number type is implemented as a "double",
   a 64-bit floating point that can represent very large and
   very small numbers.  Native integer types (char, short, int, long)
   don't have nearly as much range.  So what happens if you assign
   a Number value to a native object's .value property when
   the Number is out of range for the native type?
</p>
<p>
   Answer: the value is "truncated" to fit into the native
   integer type.  This means that the value is converted to
   its binary integer representation, and any bits beyond
   the number of bits in the type are discarded.  In
   mathematical terms, the number is reduced "modulo N",
   where N is one higher than the maximum value that the
   integer type can represent. 
</p>
<p>
   Note that this bit truncation can have weird effects for
   signed integer types.  Specifically, a large positive
   Number value can yield a negative native integer result.
   Native signed integer types represent negative values using the
   high-order bit, so truncating a large positive value can
   have the effect of leaving the high bit in the truncated
   integer set to 1, which will make the result value negative.
   This effect is familiar to C programmers, who frequently
   have to deal with these low-level storage details, but
   it might be surprising to anyone else.
</p>
<p>
   This behavior isn't as friendly as I might have liked,
   but it was chosen to parallel the way that Javascript's
   own built-in Typed Array and DataView classes work.
   It seemed best to keep the behavior consistent with
   these built-ins, since they do very similar jobs.
   Those classes likewise truncate overflowing integer
   values when assigning from Javascript Numbers.  I think
   the main reason the built-in classes work this way is
   that they were created in the first place to allow for
   high-speed processing of raw integer data; truncation
   is the fast way to handle overflows, because it's what
   the CPU will do pretty much by default in these
   situations.  Adding range checking would require
   extra computing work on every array update.  It's
   also the most flexible approach, because you can always
   add your own range checking at the Javascript level if
   you need it.
</p>


<h3>Pointer values</h3>

<p>
   Just above, we said there were three kinds of native objects:
   scalars, structs, and arrays.  But it's also worth mentioning a
   fourth case: pointers.
</p>

</p>
<div class="code">
let p = dllImport.create("int *");
</div>
<p>
   Pointers aren't actually a fourth type, but they can <i>seem</i> like
   it in some ways.  At a technical level, pointers are just scalars.
   When you create a pointer object on its own like this, it has a
   .value property, just like an int or float scalar.
</p>
<div class="code">
let v = p.value;                       // get the pointer value
p.value = NativeObject.addressOf(i);   // set the pointer to point to 'i'
</div>

<p>
   Similarly, if you use a pointer within a struct, you can get and
   set the pointer by accessing the named property in the struct.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("struct Pointers { int *a; int *b; };");
let ptrs = dllImport.create("struct Pointers");
ptrs.a = NativeObject.addressOf(i);
ptrs.b = p.value;
</div>

<p>
   So, what exactly is the .value of a pointer type?  It's a separate
   kind of system object, a <a href="NativePointer.html">NativePointer</a>.
   That object simply holds a pointer to a native memory location.
   If you get the .value of a NativeObject that contains a pointer
   type, you'll get a NativePointer.  If you want to assign a new
   value to a NativeObject that contains a pointer type, you assign
   it a NativePointer value.
</p>
<p>
   Once you have a NativePointer object, you can get a NativeObject
   for the native data it points to via its .at property.  You can
   then operate on the underlying data via the NativeObject's
   properties.  For example, if you wanted to set the integer
   value that element 'a' of our 'Pointers' points to, you
   could use say this:
</p>
<div class="code">
// ptrs = a NativeObject with a 'struct Pointers' native object
// ptrs.a = a NativePointer value for the pointer in struct element 'a'
// ptrs.a.at = the native int value the pointer points to, as a NativeObject
// ptrs.a.at.value = the underlying native value in that NativeObject
ptrs.a.at.value = 100;
</div>
   
   


<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   <b>NativeObject.addressOf(<i>nativeObject</i>):</b>
   Returns a <a href="NativePointer.html">NativePointer</a> object representing
   the physical memory address of this object's native data.  This can
   be used to set up data structures that require pointers to buffers
   of particular types.
</p>
<p>
   For native array types, this returns a pointer to the first
   element of the array.  In C-style APIs, it's common to use arrays
   and pointers interchangeably; a pointer parameter is often used
   where an array of the underlying type is actually required.
   In such cases, you can use NativeObject.addressOf() to turn
   an array object reference into the corresponding pointer value.
</p>
<p>
   Use this method cautiously!  If you use it to get the address
   of a native object created by DLL code, that native object
   isn't tracked by the Javascript garbage collector, so Javascript
   can't guarantee that the underlying native memory stays valid
   for the lifetime of the NativePointer object.  It's your
   responsibility to manage the lifetime of the underlying
   native memory in such cases, just as though you were programming
   in a lower level language like C or C++.
</p>
<p>
   <b>NativeObject.addressOf(<i>nativeObject</i>, <i>element</i>):</b>
   This form of addressOf() lets you get the address of an individual
   element within a struct or array.  In the case of a struct, <i>element</i>
   is a string giving the name of the element:
</p>
<div class="code">
let s = dllImport.create("struct { int a; double b; }");
let p = NativeObject.addressOf(s, "b");  // address of s.b (in C terms, &amp;s-&gt;b)
</div>
<p>
   For an array, <i>element</i> is an integer giving the array index:
</p>
<div class="code">
let arr = dllImport.create("double[10]");
let p = NativeObject.addressOf(arr, 5);     // address of arr[5]
</div>

<p>
   <i>element</i> can only go "one deep" in terms of nested type
   naming.  In other words, it can <i>only</i> be a single struct element
   name <i>or</i> a single array index.  For a nested type, dereference the
   nested object in the native object expression instead of trying to
   build a complex expression in <i>element</i>:
</p>
<div class="code">
let s = dllImport.create(`
struct {
   struct {
      int a;
      int b;
   } sub[5];
}`);
let p = NativeObject.addressOf(p, "sub[1].a");  // ERROR
let p = NativeObject.addressOf(p.sub[1], "a");  // correct
</div>

<p>
   <b><i>nativeObject</i>[<i>index</i>]:</b>  For array types only, this
   accesses the <i>index</i>th element of the array.  The first element
   is at index 0.  As with .value, this is a getter/setter, so you can
   use it to read the value of an array element or assign a value to
   an array element.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>nativeObject</i>.<i>structElement</i>:</b>  For struct types
   only, this accesses the struct field of the native type with the
   given name.  This is a getter/setter like .value, so you can use
   it to read the value of a struct member element or assign a new
   value to the element.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>nativeObject</i>.length:</b>  For array types only, this is
   a read-only property that returns the number of elements in the array.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>nativeObject</i>.value:</b>  For a scalar value only, this is
   a getter/setter that reads or writes the internal native data value.
   When you use .value in an expression, the internal value is converted
   to a suitable Javascript type, and that value is returned.  When you
   assign to .value, the Javascript value assigned is translated into
   the native type and written to the internal native value memory.
</p>
