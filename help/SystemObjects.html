<h1>PinballY Objects</h1>

<p>
   The PinballY Javascript system provides a number of special system
   objects for access to the application and user interface environment.
   These are in many ways the PinballY analogs of the system objects
   in Web browser Javascript, such as "window" and "document".
</p>
<p>
   These objects are global, so you can access them by name anywhere
   in your scripting code.
