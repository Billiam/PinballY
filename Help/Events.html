<h1>Events</h1>

<p>
   PinballY's event system is modeled on the event framework used
   in Web browsers.  There are three main concepts in this framework:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Event:</b>  Abstractly, an event is something that occurs
   asynchronously (that is, at any time) and externally to the Javascript
   program, such as the user pressing a keyboard key.  In more concrete
   terms, each time an outside event occurs, the system creates a
   Javascript object to represent the event and describe its details.
   Each event is represented by a new object, derived from the
   <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class.  This object uses Javascript
   properties to describe the event, such as which key the user pressed.
   
   <li><b>Event target:</b>  This is a system object that receives
   events from the operating system when they occur.  Most of the
   user interface events in PinballY are sent to the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object.  All event target objects implement the <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>
   interface, which provides a set of standard methods you can call to
   add and remove your custom event listeners.  You don't implement
   these objects yourself - they're provided by the system.  You 
   refer to them by name to set up your event listeners.

   <li><b>Event Listener:</b>  This is a Javascript function you write to
   carry out a custom response when a particular type of event occurs.
   You register a listener function with a specific event target object
   to tell the system that you want the listener to be called when a
   particular event occurs.  For example, you can register a function
   that will be called each time the user presses a key.  After you
   register a listener, the system calls it each time an event of the
   desired type occurs.  The system passes an Event object to your
   listener function as a parameter on each call, to convey the details
   of that individual event to the listener.
</ul>

<p>
   In terms of practical usage, you usually have to perform two tasks
   to set up custom event handling.
</p>
<p>
   First, you write a listener function for each event you're interested in.
   This is simply a Javascript function that takes a single "event"
   parameter.  When invoked, the "event" parameter will be filled in
   with an Event object describing the details of the event that occurred,
   such as which keyboard key was pressed.
</p>
<div class="code">
function myKeyListener(ev)
{
    log("The " + ev.key + " key was pressed!");
}
</div>
<p>
   Note: unlike some older browsers, there's no "global" event
   object that you can refer to.  The event details are always
   passed to each listener via the event object parameter.
</p>
<p>
   Second, you register the listener with the appropriate target
   object for that event type.  For example, you register keyboard
   event listeners with the mainWindow object:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown", myKeyListener);
</div>

<p>
   You normally register your event listeners somewhere in the
   "outer" code in main.js, meaning code that's not contained
   in any function or class block.  All of the "outer" code in
   the main file is executed when the system initially loads
   the script, so putting your registration calls there will
   ensure that the listeners are set up as soon as the code
   is loaded.
</p>
<p>
   Event registration is completely dynamic, so you
   can also add and remove listeners at any time.  You might
   want to listen for certain events only when the system is
   in certain modes, for example, so you might have event
   handlers that are registered and removed by other event
   handlers.

<h2>Event types</h2>

<b>Joystick button events:</b>  See <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a>.
<ul>
   <li><b>joystickbuttondown:</b>  Fires on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object when a joystick button is pressed.  Also fires each time a button auto-repeats
   while the user is holding the button down.

   <li><b>joystickbuttonup:</b>  Fires on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object when a joystick button is released.
</ul>

<b>Keyboard events:</b>  See <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a>.
<ul>
   <li><b>keydown:</b>  Fires on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object when a keyboard key is pressed.  Also fires each time a key auto-repeats
   while the user is holding the key down.

   <li><b>keyup:</b>  Fires on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object when a keyboard key is released.
</ul>
