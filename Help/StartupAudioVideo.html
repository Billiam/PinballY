<h1>Startup Audio and Video</h1>

<p>
   You can make PinballY play a custom audio and/or video file whenever the
   program starts up.  Setting up the startup items is just a matter of
   creating suitable files in the <b>Media</b> folder within your main
   PinballY program folder.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Custom startup video:</b>  Place a file called <b>Startup Video.mp4</b>
   in the PinballY <b>Media</b> folder.  It has to use that exact name, including
   the space, but you can change the suffix from .mp4 to any of the other
   supported video format extensions (.mpg, .f4v, .mkv, .wmv, .m4v, .avi).
   If a file with this name (using any of the supported extensions) exists,
   PinballY will automatically play it in the main playfield window
   each time the program starts.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Custom startup audio:</b>  Place a file called <b>Startup Audio.mp3</b>
   in the PinballY <b>Media</b> folder.  Use that exact name, including the
   space, but you can change the suffix from .mp3 to .wav or .ogg if you
   wish to use one of those formats.  As with the startup video, the program
   will automatically play back this file each time you start a new session.
</p>

<p>
   If the startup audio and startup video files are both present, PinballY
   will simply play them both at the same time.  It's best to use a silent
   video in this case so that the soundtracks aren't trying to shout each
   other down.
