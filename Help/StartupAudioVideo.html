<h1>Startup Audio and Video</h1>

<p>
   You can make PinballY play a custom audio and/or video file whenever the
   program starts up.  Setting up the startup items is just a matter of
   creating certain files in subfolders of the main Media folder, as
   explained below.
</p>
<h2>Folder location2</h2>
<p>
   PinballY looks for startup media files in two locations:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Your main media folder, as configured with the Media Folder
   option in the <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a> section
   in the settings

   <li>The <b>Media</b> folder within your PinballY program folder
</ul>

<p>
   These two locations might be identical, which is the case if you've chosen
   to keep your media files within the PinballY install folder.
   But they'll be different if you're using a PinballX or HyperPin
   installation as your main media folder.  In that case, the media
   folder set in the options will be searched first, so files in
   that location will take precedence.
</p>

<h2>Custom startup video</h2>

<p>
   You can show custom videos in any combination of PinballY's windows
   each time the program starts.  
</p>
<p>
   These files all go in the <b>Startup Videos</b> folder within your
   Media folder (see "Folder locations" above).
</p>
<p>
   Each file's name determines which window it's displayed in:
</p>

<table class="dataTable">
   <tr><th>Window</th><th>Filename</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Playfield</td><td>Startup Video.<i>ext</i></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Backglass</td><td>Startup Video (bg).<i>ext</i></td></tr>
   <tr><td>DMD</td><td>Startup Video (dmd).<i>ext</i></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Topper</td><td>Startup Video (topper).<i>ext</i></td></tr>
   <tr><td>Instruction Card</td><td>Startup Video (instcard).<i>ext</i></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
   For all of these files, the extension <i>.ext</i> can be any of the
   supported video file suffixes:  .mpg, .f4v, .mkv, .wmv, .m4v, or .avi.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY loads all of the startup videos and starts playback simultaneously,
   or as close to simultaneously as possible.  This lets you coordinate effects
   across the separate videos to some extent, since the videos should all be
   synchronized to the same playback clock.  If you want effects in two or
   more of the videos to occur simultaneously in playback, simply edit the
   videos so that the events occur at the same time code in each video.
</p>

<h2>Custom startup audio</h2>
<p>
   Use this to play an audio clip each time PinballY starts.
</p>
<p>
   This file goes in the <b>Startup Sounds</b> folder within your Media
   folder (see "Folder locations" above).
</p>
<p>
   Name the file <b>Startup Audio<i>.ext</i></b>, where <i>.ext</i> is
   any of the recognized audio format suffixes: .mp3, .ogg, or .wav.
</p>   
<p>
   If startup audio and startup video files are present, PinballY
   will simply play them all at the same time.  If you're using a separate
   startup audio file, you'll probably want to make sure your startup videos
   are silent, so that the various soundtracks aren't trying to shout each
   other down.
