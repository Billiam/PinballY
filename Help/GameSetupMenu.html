<h1>Game Setup Menu</h1>

<p>
   PinballY lets you handle game setup through the regular user interface.
   There are no separate programs you have to run, and it shouldn't be
   necessary to edit any configuration or database files by hand.
   (It's <i>possible</i> to edit the game list data files by hand,
   since they're all stored in human-readable text formats, but you
   shouldn't ever have to look at or edit any of those.  If you're
   curious about the details of how the various game setup files
   are stored, see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.)
</p>
<p>
   Most of the commands for setting up your game list are in the
   Game Setup menu:
</p>

<img src="GameSetupMenu.jpg" class="example">

<p>
   There are two ways to access this menu:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For new game files for which you haven't entered any details yet,
   a Game Setup command will appear the top of the main menu (the one
   you see when you press the Start button, usually assigned to the
   "1" key [that's the digit one]).

   <li>For games whose details you've already entered, the Game Setup
   command <i>doesn't</i> appear in the main menu.  Instead, you can
   access the Game Setup command on the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>,
   which is normally assigned to the "0" (digit zero) key.

   <p>
      The Game Setup command is removed from the main menu after you
      set up a game for two reasons.  One is to streamline the menu;
      most people don't want to see administrative options when just
      browsing games to play.  Another is to reduce the chances that
      a regular user playing with your cab will accidentally get into
      the setup menus and mess up your configuration.
   </p>
</ul>

<h2>Setup menu commands</h2>

<p>
   <b>Edit game details:</b>  Opens the <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Game Details</a>
   dialog, which is where you can enter the game's metadata information (title,
   manufacturer, year of release) and select options for displaying and
   launching the game.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Delete game details:</b>  Deletes the game's XML database entry, which
   removes its metadata information.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Hide this game:</b>  Marks the game as "hidden", so that it doesn't show
   up in the wheel interface under any of the standard filters.  You can still
   view the hidden games, though, by selecting "Show Hidden Games" in the
   <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>.  The "hidden" option is
   useful for any table file that you want to keep around but don't want
   to make playable, such as backup copies, old versions, testing versions, etc.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Select categories:</b>  Shows the category list menu, which lets you
   add and remove category tags for the current game.  A category tag is just
   an arbitrary short text term, such as "Movie Theme" or "Science Fiction",
   that you find useful to classify games in your collection.  You can make
   up as many category tags as you like, and you can assign any set of tags
   to any game.  Once tags are assigned, you can use the "Filter by Category"
   command in the main menu to display games matching a particular tag.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Capture images &amp; videos:</b>  This lets you create background
   image and videos for the current game by launching the game and taking
   live screen shots and video captures of the game in action.  Selecting
   this command shows a series of prompts gathering information on which
   items to capture.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Mark for batch capture:</b>  Marks the current game for inclusion
   in the next <a href="OperatorMenu.html#batchCapture">Batch Capture</a> operation.
   This lets you create an ad hoc group of games to include in a batch.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Find game media online:</b>  Opens a browser window and initiates a
   Web search for HyperPin "Media Packs" for the current game.  The search
   term is based on the game's title, and in most cases it will find at
   least one matching media pack in the top few search results.  This is
   a quick way to find online media without having to do a lot of manual
   searching.  You'll probably want to use the "Capture" option for most
   of the background media items, but Media Packs are still great additions,
   because they usually contain several items that you can't get via a
   screen capture:  a logo for the game to display in the wheel UI,
   images of the game's original apron instruction cards, and scans of
   the marketing flyer that the manufacturer created to advertise the
   game when it was released.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Show media files:</b>  Opens the media file list for the current
   game, which shows the directory locations and filenames for all of the
   game's image, video, and audio files.  This can be quite helpful when
   troubleshooting media display problems, and also lets you see at a
   glance exactly which media items are installed for the game and where
   they all are.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Cancel:</b> Closes the menu.
