<h1>FilterInfo</h1>

<p>
   A FilterInfo object contains information on a game filter, which
   is essentially a selection rule that selects a subset of games to
   show in the wheel UI.  The system provides a number of predefined
   filters, such as the era filters ("1970s games"), manufacturer
   filters ("Gottlieb games"), and system filters ("Visual Pinball X
   games").  You can also create your own <a href="#custom">custom
   filters</a>, which we'll explain below.
</p>
<p>
   The main wheel UI lets the user select which filter to use at any
   given time via the menu system.  Whenever the selected filter changes,
   a <a href="FilterSelectEvent.html"><b>filterselect</b></a> event
   is fired.  You can use this to do additional work as needed when the
   filter selection changes.
</p>


<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
   You don't create FilterInfo objects directly.  You get them by
   calling <a href="GameList.html#getFilterInfo">gameList.getFilterInfo()</a>.
   That function returns a FilterInfo object populated with details about
   the filter you specified.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to create a custom filter, see <a href="#custom">Custom
   filters</a> below.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   <b>cmd:</b>  An integer command ID value.  This will always be
   in the range from command.FilterFirst to command.FilterLast (see
   <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>).  (The command ID is assigned
   for the current session only, so it shouldn't be saved externally.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>getGames():</b>  Returns an array of <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   objects listing all games that the filter currently selects.
</p>

<p>
   <b>group:</b>  A string giving the menu group for the filter.  System
   filters all have groups with names enclosed in [square brackets].  These
   are never displayed to the user; the system uses localized menu
   titles for the groups instead.  User-defined filters have optional group
   names defined when the filter was created; these can refer to system
   groups, or can be given as the actual menu title to show in the main
   menu.  This is omitted if the filter isn't part of a menu group.
</p>
<p>
   <b>groupCmd:</b>  An integer giving the <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a>
   associated with the group.  This is the command used for the menu item shown
   in the main menu, if any, that opens the group submenu.   This is undefined if
   the filter isn't part of a group, or it's part of one of the top-level groups
   that doesn't have an associated command ([Top], [Op]).
</p>

<p>
   <b>id:</b>  The ID of the filter (see <a href="#filterID">Filter IDs</a>).
   This is a permanent ID for the filter, so it can be stored in external
   files or settings.
</p>

<p>
   <b>testGame(<i>game</i>)</b>:  Determines whether the filter includes
   or excludes the given game.  <i>game</i> is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object specifying the game to test.  Returns true if the filter includes the game in
   its selection list, false if the filter excludes the game.  (If <i>game</i>
   doesn't refer to a valid game, the return value is null, which for conditional
   purposes is equivalent to false, but can be distinguished with the Javascript
   === operator if the distinction is important to your code for some reason.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>title:</b>  A string giving the display title of the filter as
   it appears in menus.  Note that this might be localized, and might change
   across versions, so you shouldn't use it to recognize a particular
   filter; use the <b>id</b> value for that.
</p>


<a name="filterID"></a>
<h2>Filter IDs</h2>
<p>
   Each filter defined by the system has a unique ID string.  This ID
   string is designed to be permanent across sessions, so it can be
   stored in external files and saved settings.
</p>
<p>
   Each class of predefined system filters uses an ID that follows a
   particular format.  You can test filter IDs against these formats
   if you want to recognize specific filters or specific classes of
   filters.  Here are the ID formats for the system's filters:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>AddedBefore.<i>N</i>:</b> selects games added to the database
   via PinballY's "Edit Game Details" dialog earlier than <i>N</i> days ago;
   the system creates filters for 7, 30, and 365 days

   <li><b>AddedWithin.<i>N</i>:</b> selects games added to the database
   via PinballY's "Edit Game Details" dialog within the past <i>N</i> days;
   the system creates filters for 7, 30, and 365 days
   
   <li><b>All:</b> the All Games filter, which selects all non-hidden games

   <li><b>Category.<i>name</i>:</b>  selects games tagged with category <i>name</i>

   <li><b>Favorites:</b> the Favorites filter, which selects games with
   the user-set "favorite" flag

   <li><b>Hidden:</b> the Hidden Games filter, which selects only games
   with the user-set "hidden" flag; these games are excluded by all
   other built-in filters

   <li><b>Manuf.<i>name</i>:</b> selects games whose manufacturer names
   in the XML database match <i>name</i>

   <li><b>NeverPlayed:</b> selects games that have never been played
   under PinballY

   <li><b>NotPlayedWithin.<i>N</i>:</b> selects games not played within
   the past <i>N</i> days using PinballY

   <li><b>PlayedWithin.<i>N</i>:</b> selects games played within the past
   <i>N</i> days using PinballY; the system creates filters for 7, 30, and 365 days

   <li><b>Rating.<i>N</i></b>: <i>N</i> is from 0 to 5; the star rating
   filters, each of which selects games with <i>N</i>- or <i>N</i>&frac12;-star
   ratings

   <li><b>Rating.-1</b>: the Unrated Games filter, which selects games
   that don't have star ratings

   <li><b>Uncategorized:</b> selects games with no category tags

   <li><b>Unconfigured:</b> the Unconfigured Games filter, which selects
   only games with no XML database entries

   <li><b>User.<i>id</i></b>: a user-defined filter created via
   <a href="GameList.html#createFilter">gameList.createFilter()</a>;
   the <i>id</i> portion is the <b>id</b> property specified in the
   filter descriptor when creating the new filter.  See <a href="#custom">Custom filters</a>
   above.

   <li><b>YearRange.<i>from</i>.<i>to</i>:</b>  selects games with
   release years between <i>from</i> and <i>to</i>, inclusive; the
   system creates one such filter for each 20th century decade that
   includes at least one database entry (e.g., YearRange.1970.1979
   is the 1970s filter), and one filter for all years from 2000 onward
   (this uses 9999 as the ending year, to essentially mean "the end
   of time", so the actual ID is YearRange.2000.9999)
</ul>
   
   

<a name="custom"></a>
<h2>Custom filters</h2>
<p>
   You can define your own custom filters via
   <a href="GameList.html#createFilter">gameList.createFilter(<i>desc</i>)</a>.
   This function creates a new filter with a selection rule you define
   via a Javascript function, which can express just about any kind of
   selection criteria you can think of.
</p>
<p>
   The return value from gameList.createFilter() is a <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a>
   that the system assigns for use by the filter.  This is used if the
   filter is automatically added to system menus (see <a href="#menuPlacement">Automatic
   menu placement</a> below).  You can also use this command ID if
   you want to create an item for this filter in any custom menus.
   The command will always be in the range from command.FilterFirst to
   command.FilterLast, which is shared with the built-in system filters.
   The newly assigned command will always be chosen to be unique,
   so it won't conflict with any system filters.
<p>
   The <i>desc</i> argument to createFilter() is an object describing
   the new filter.  It contains the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b>  Required.  A string giving the ID of the new filter.
   This is an arbitrary string you provide to identify the filter in
   the settings file.  You can use letters, numbers, underscores, and
   periods in the ID.  The ID must be unique across all filters in
   the system, so it's a good idea to include some kind of author
   name or organization name prefix ("mjr.TitleLength.Short").
   The ID must be permanent (always the same across sessions), so that
   it can match the saved filter ID in the settings file when restoring
   settings in a future session.

   <li><b>title:</b>  Required.  A title for the filter.  This will be
   used in the status line messages when this filter is active, if any
   status line messages include the filter name.  It's also used by
   default as the menu title for the filter, but you can override
   that with menuTitle.

   <li><b>menuTitle:</b>  Optional.  The title for the filter as it
   appears in menus.  The <b>title</b> string is used if this isn't
   specified.  The separate menu title is sometimes useful when the
   filter is part of a group, where it's nicer to avoid repeating
   the same verbiage for every menu in the group.  The system
   "Played Within" menus use this capability, listing just the
   time frame in the menu, 

   <li><b>select:</b>  Required.  The selection function.  When
   the filter is activated (that is, when the user selects this as
   the current filter in the wheel UI), this function is called
   once for each game in the game database, to determine which
   games are selected by the filter and which are excluded.
   The function takes one argument, a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object describing a game to test for inclusion.  The function
   returns true if the game is included in the filter's selection,
   false if not.

   <li><b>before:</b>  Optional.  This is a function, which is
   called once each time the filter is activated, just before
   scanning the list of games through the <b>select</b> function.
   The function is called with no arguments, and any return value
   is ignored.  This function gives the filter a chance to initialize
   in preparation for the game list scan; it can, for example, cache
   any information that will be needed on each <b>select</b> call,
   or initialize internal counters.

   <li><b>after:</b>  Optional.  A function that's called just
   after the game list scan has been completed.  The filter can
   do any necessary cleanup, store final counter values, etc.

   <li><b>group:</b>  Optional.  The group name for the filter.
   If provided, the system's main menu will include a menu item
   with this name, which shows a submenu with all filters in this
   group.  Use a name that makes a good title for this menu item,
   such as "Filter by Title Length".  If omitted, the filter isn't
   automatically included in any system menus, but you can still
   select it via your own custom menus or via <a href="#setCurFilter">gameList.setCurFilter()</a>.

   <li><b>sortKey:</b>  Optional.  A string giving a menu sorting key
   for this filter relative to other filters in its group.  When
   the group menu is displayed, the menu items are sorted according
   to this key, in alphabetical order.  The <b>title</b> string is
   used by default, so that the menu items appear in alphabetical
   order of title.  That's not always the most desirable order
   for some groups, though.  For example, if you had a group that
   filters by game title, with entries for "Short Titles", "Medium-Length
   Titles", and "Long Title", it would make more sense to display the
   menu in that order (short, medium, long) rather than alphabetically.
   You could accomplish that by using sort keys "A", "B", and "C"
   for the short, medium, and long items, respectively.  The
   sort key is never displayed anywhere, so you can use whatever's
   convenient to get the desired sorting order.

   <li><b>includeHidden:</b>  Optional.  If true, games marked as
   hidden by the user are included in the set of games tested
   with the <b>select</b> function; if omitted or false, hidden
   games are assumed to be omitted, so they're not even tested
   with the <b>select</b> function, saving a little bit of time
   by skipping unnecessary tests.  This is called out as a separate
   test because all of the system filters exclude hidden games,
   except for the "Hidden Games" filter, which <i>only</i> includes
   hidden games.  Setting this to true won't necessarily cause
   hidden games to appear on the wheel; rather, it allows hidden
   games to be tested by your <b>select</b> function for inclusion.
   You should only set this to true when your filter is explicitly
   some kind of hidden games filter, because it might be confusing
   for the user to see games they intentionally marked as hidden
   show up in a filter that isn't specifically about hidden games.

   <li><b>includeUnconfig:</b>  Optional.  If true, games that
   aren't configured (meaning they have no XML data entries) are
   included in the set of games tested with your <b>select</b>
   function.  If false or undefined, <i>and</i> the user has selected
   the "hide unconfigured games" option in the settings, unconfigured
   games are assumed to be omitted, so they aren't even tested with
   the <b>select</b> function to save some time.  Note that setting
   this to true might cause unwanted behavior, since it goes against
   the user's instructions to "hide unconfigured games" from most
   filters.  You should only set this if your filter is explicitly
   some kind of unconfigured selection filter, so that it doesn't
   confuse the user when unconfigured games appear there.

   <li><b>compareForSort:</b>  Optional.  A function that compares
   two games, to determine the sorting order of the games in the
   wheel when the filter is in effect.  This function has this form:
   <div class="indented code javascript">
function(a, b) {
    /* sort in order of manufacturing date */
    return a.year - b.year;
}</div>
   <p>
      <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
      objects.  The function compares the two and returns a number:
      a negative value if <b>a</b> comes before <b>b</b> in the desired sorting
      order, 0 if they're equal, and a positive value if <b>a</b> comes
      after <b>b</b>.  This makes the comparison a sort of "subtraction"
      function: if you think about the games as integer values, this
      is the result you get by simply computing <b>a minus b</b>.
      If you were sorting by manufacturing year, for example, you
      could do literally that, by returning <b>a.year - b.year</b>.
   </p>
   <p>
      When the filter is
      activated, the system will call this function on pairs of games
      to be included in the filter to sort them into the correct
      order.  This function will be called repeatedly during the
      sorting process each time the filter is activated, so it should
      be simple and fast.
   </p>
   <p>
      For many custom sorts, you'll probably want to sort games
      alphabetically if they're not otherwise distinguishable for
      your sort criteria.  For example, if you're sorting by original
      manufacturing year, chances are that you'll have multiple games
      released during the same year for many of the years.  In those
      cases, you'll probably want to use alphabetical sorting as
      a secondary rule.  Here's how you can do this using Javascript's
      <b>localeCompare()</b> method, which returns the same sort
      of "subtraction" value we need after comparing two strings
      alphabetically:
   </p>
   <div class="indented code javascript">
function(a, b) {
    let diff = a.year - b.year;
    return diff || a.title.localeCompare(b.title);
} </div>
   <p>
      That first tests to see if you can distinguish the games by
      year, and if so, returns the year difference, which satisfies
      our "subtraction" rule for the return value.  If the years
      are the same, we fall back on the titles to determine the
      relative order of the two games by using localeCompare().
   </p>
   <p>
      The sorting function is optional.  If you omit it, the standard
      alphabetical sorting is used.  If you provide a custom sorting
      function, you will also usually want to define a custom <b>pageGroup</b>
      function, since the default grouping by first letter of the title
      probably won't make sense if the games aren't sorted alphabetically.
   </p>
   <li><b>pageGroup:</b> Optional.  A function that returns the
   "paging group" for a game, which determines how games are grouped
   for the Next Page and Previous Page navigation commands in the
   game wheel.  When the user presses one of the Next/Previous Page
   buttons, the system steps through games until it finds the next
   or previous game that has a different paging group from the
   current game.  By default, the paging groups are simply based
   on the first letter of the title, so all of the games with
   titles starting with "A" are grouped together, etc.  The
   function has this form:
   <div class="indentec code javascript">
function(game) { return 17; }
   </div>
   <p>
      <b>game</b> is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object.
      The return value is an integer giving the group number for
      the game.  The group number value is entirely up to your
      function to define; all that matters is that all games that
      belong to the same paging group must have the same group
      number.  For example, for the default grouping by first letter
      of the title, the group number could simply be the Unicode
      character code of the first letter of the title (and that's
      just what the system's default grouping function uses).
      If you wanted to group games by decade, you could return
      first year of the decade that the game was manufactured
      in; e.g., return 1980 for a game made in 1983.
   </p>
   <p>
      The page grouping <b>doesn't</b> affect the sorting order
      of the games.  The sorting order is controlled entirely
      by the custom sorting function.  The grouping only controls
      how far the wheel turns on a Next/Previous Page command.
      Those commands are processed simply by advancing the wheel
      in the selected direction until finding a game with a
      different group from the current game.  That's why the
      sorting function and grouping function have to be designed
      to work together: the sorting function has to sort the
      games into an order such that they group together into
      the paging groups naturally.  If you're grouping games
      by first letter of title, they must be sorted in some
      kind of alphabetical order - not necessarily A-Z, but
      some order where the A's are all grouped together, etc.
   </p>
   <p>
      There's one "special" group number: 0, the un-group.
      If the grouping function returns 0 for a given game,
      the wheel will never stop on that game.  This lets you
      specify that certain games should be skipped during
      Next/Previous Page commands.  For example, if you were
      grouping alphabetically, but you always wanted to skip
      over games with non-alphabetic titles (such as "2001" or "4-Square"),
      you could return 0 for those games.
   </p>
   <p>
      The paging group function is optional.  If you omit it,
      the standard grouping by first letter of the title is
      used.  That default grouping usually wouldn't make sense
      if you change the sort order, though, so custom sorting
      and custom grouping usually go hand-in-hand - if you
      specify a custom sorting function, you should define a
      corresponding custom grouping function, and vice versa.
   </p>
</ul>

<a name="menuPlacement"></a>
<h2>Automatic menu placement</h2>

<p>
   <b>Custom filter group menus:</b>
   If you give the filter a <b>group</b> property, the system
   automatically creates a new menu item for the group in the
   top-level menu.  Selecting this menu opens a sub-menu showing
   all of the filters with the same <b>group</b> property.  The
   group menu is added after the standard filter group items
   in the standard menu (Filter by Era, Filter by Manufacturer,
   and so on), so this lets you create your own custom filter
   groups of the same style.  The <b>group</b> property string
   is displayed as the menu title, so you'll probably want to use
   similar wording ("Filter by <i>something</i>") so that the
   menu meshes well with the existing items.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Adding the filter to an existing group:</b>
   Instead of creating a custom filter group, you can add
   a custom filter to one of the existing groups.  This would
   be appropriate if the filter augments one of those groups.
   For example, you could add your own "recently played"
   filter that selects a time period that's not covered
   in the standard set, or a "manufacturer" filter that
   selects games from all of the WMS brands.  For the
   predefined system filter groups, though, you don't
   use the name that appears in the menu.  Instead, you
   have to refer to a special internal name.  We use the
   internal name instead of the name in the menu because
   the menu name can be localized for different languages;
   the internal name doesn't have to be translated, since
   it's never displayed to the user, so you can always
   count on it being the same.  The system filter groups
   are shown below.
</p>
<a name="systemFilterGroups"></a>
<ul>
   <li><b>[Era]</b> - the decade and era filters (70s Tables, etc).
   The menu sorting keys for these filters are the four-digit <i>starting</i>
   year of the decade, so "1970" for 70s Tables.  If you want to slot
   in your own filter at a specific place in the menu, set the <b>sort</b>
   property to a string that sorts where you want it relative to those
   four-digit year strings.  Note that the numeric value isn't
   important; the order is based on the lexical ordering of the string,
   not the numeric value.

   <li><b>[Manuf]</b> - the manufacturer filters (Williams Tables,
   etc).  The sort keys are the manufacturer names.

   <li><b>[Sys]</b> - the player system filters (Visual Pinball 9
   Tables, etc).  The sort keys are the system  names.

   <li><b>[Rating]</b> - the star rating filters.  The sort keys
   are the digits for the star values, "1", "2", etc.  The "unrated"
   filter has sort key "Z" to force it to the end of the list.

   <li><b>[Cat]</b> - the individual category filters.  The sort
   keys are the category names.  The "uncategorized" filter has
   sort key "\uE800": that's Unicode code point E800, a special
   Unicode "private use" character that sorts after all alphabetic
   characters from all languages in the Unicode set, so that the
   uncategorized filter sorts after all actual categories.  Note
   that the Unicode private use area is from \uE000 to \uF8FF,
   and we intentionally used a character from the middle of this
   region to let you slot in custom filters after all of the
   named categories but before "Uncategorized", by using
   sort keys starting with characters from \uE000 to \uE7FF.

   <li><b>[Played]</b> - the "played within" time filters.
   The sort keys are the number of days expressed as five
   digits with leading zeroes, so "played within a week" has
   sort key 00007.  The "Recently Played" menu has an internal
   structure with separate groups for the "played within",
   "not played within", and "never played" filters, so "played within"
   sort keys are only compared to other "played within" keys.

   <li><b>[!Played]</b> - the "not played within" time filters.
   These likewise have sort keys with the number of days
   expressed as five digits.

   <li><b>[!!Played]</b> - the "never played filter.  This
   has sort key "Z" (which isn't normally used at all, since
   this item normally appears in a group by itself within
   the "Recently Played" submenu; but the sort key is there
   just in case you want to add another item to the group).

   <li><b>[Added]</b> - the "added within" time filters.
   The sort keys are the number of days expressed as five
   digits, as with the "played within" filters.

   <li><b>[!Added]</b> - the "added before" time filters.
   The sort keys are the number of days expressed as five digits.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Adding to a top-level menu:</b>
   There are two special filter groups that go in top-level
   menus rather than in group submenus, "[Top]" (the main
   menu), and "[Op]" (the operator menu).  If you use one of
   these strings for the <b>group</b> property, your filter
   will appear in the corresponding menu.  Use this
   capability sparingly, since the menus will quickly
   become unusable if you add too many top-level items.
   If you're creating more than one or two filters that
   don't belong in obvious groups, you'll probably want
   to create a "Custom Filters" or "Filter by Misc"
   group as a catch-all, to avoid too much clutter in the
   top level menus.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[Top]</b> - filters that appear directly in the
   main menu.  The system filters in this group are "All Games",
   (sort key "3000"), "Favorites" (sort key "7000").  The
   sort keys are chosen so that the built-in menu items appear
   in this order, and to make it easy for you to slot in
   any number of your custom filters before, between, or after
   the built-in items, should you want to add any custom
   filters to the top-level menu.

   <li><b>[Op]</b> - filters that appear directly in the
   Operator menu.  the system filters in this group are
   "Hidden Games" (sort key "3000"), "Unconfigured Games"
   (sort key "7000").  The sort keys are chosen to make it
   easy for you to slot in your own custom filters before,
   between, or after the predefined system items, should
   you want to add any filters of your own to the Operator
   menu.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>If you want to skip the automatic menu inclusion:</b>
   Just leave <b>group</b> undefined if you don't want the system
   to automatically show the filter in any of the standard menus.
   You can control the menu placement more precisely using
   the menu customization mechanisms described in <a href="Menus.html">Menus</a>.  
   You can also activate the filter entirely under script control via
   <a href="GameList.html#setCurFilter">gameList.setCurFilter()</a>.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
   <b>"Played within two weeks" filter:</b>  Suppose you wanted to
   supplement the standard "played within" filters with some more
   time periods than offered in the standard menus.  Here's a filter
   that selects games played within the last two weeks.  The filter
   is automatically included in the "Filter by Last Played" group
   because it uses the special system group "[Played]".
</p>
<div class="code">
let filterReferenceDate;
gameList.createFilter({
    id: "PlayedWithin.14",
    title: "Played Within 2 Weeks",
    group: "[Played]",  // add to the standard Recently Played menu
    sortKey: "00014",   // number of days as a five-digit string
    before: function()
    {
        // Figure the reference date: 12:00AM at the start of the
        // day 14 days ago.  Javascript's Date constructor conveniently
        // accepts day-of-the-month values outside of the 1..31 range,
        // which it interprets by projecting forwards or backwards into
        // ajacent months until finding a valid date.  So if the current
        // day is Jan 1, 2019, then new Date(2019, 0, -13) will work
        // backwards to December 18, 2018.  And since that works in
        // terms of dates in the local time zone, it even properly
        // takes into account special situtions, such as the usually
        // nettlesome transitions between daylight time and standard
        // time.
        //
        // Note that we *could* compute this value on every select()
        // call rather than caching it, but it makes things go a little
        // faster if we do this computation once ahead of time.  The
        // system will call this before() function every time it's
        // about to do a scan of the table list, so we'll always have
        // a fresh reference point for each new scan.

        // start with today's date
        let d = new Date();

        // now construct a date 14 days before today, at 12:00 AM
        filterReferenceDate = new Date(d.getFullYear(), d.getMonth(), d.getDate() - 14, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    },
    select: function(game) { return game.lastPlayed >= filterReferenceDate; }
});
</div>

<p>
   <b>Short, medium, and long titles:</b>  For
   this example, we'll create a group of filters that select according to the
   length of a game's title: short (6 character or fewer), medium
   (7-15 characters), or long (16+ characters).  We'll create
   these as three filters that appear on a custom submenu, which will 
   be reachable from a new top-level menu item called
   "Filter by Title Length".  This is a pretty contrived
   example, but it shows how to create a custom filter group and present
   it in the main menu.  
</p>
<div class="code">
gameList.createFilter({
    id: "Names.Short",
    title: "Short Titles",
    group: "Filter by Title Length",
    select: function(game) { return game.title.length <= 6; },
    sortKey: "A"
});
gameList.createFilter({
    id: "Names.Medium",
    title: "Medium-length Titles",
    group: "Filter by Title Length",
    select: function(game) { return game.title.length > 6 && game.title.length <= 15; },
    sortKey: "B"
});
gameList.createFilter({
    id: "Names.Long",
    title: "Long Titles",
    group: "Filter by Title Length",
    select: function(game) { return game.title.length > 15; },
    sortKey: "C"
});
</div>
<p>
   One thing to note here is that
   we gave each filter a <b>sort key</b>.  Sort keys are optional,
   but in this case, it's nice to include one.  Without an explicit
   sort key, the system would just sort the menu items alphabetically
   by their labels.
   That's usually great, but this is one of those cases where the
   "natural" order that a user would expect isn't alphabetical.
   The intuitive order here is clearly short, medium, long.  The
   sort keys let us override the default alphabetical sorting
   and provide our own custom sorting instead.  When you provide
   sort keys, the system sorts the menus alphabetically by the
   sort keys, rather than alphabetically by the visible label.
   That lets you put the menus in any order you want, without
   having to change the labels.
</p>
<p>
   The sort keys aren't visible to the user
   anywhere, so we can use any arbitrary strings that are
   convenient for putting things into the right order.  In this
   case, we simply use "A", "B", and "C".  If you wanted to leave gaps for
   inserting more items in the future, you could have made those
   "A", "M", and "Z", or something more flexible like "1000", "2000",
   and "3000".  But for our fixed list of three items, the simplistic
   "A", "B", "C" will do just fine.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you can use numeric strings like "1000" and "2000" for
   sort keys, but remember that they're still treated as <b>strings</b>,
   meaning they're sorted "lexically" rather than numerically.  This
   has some odd consequences when you use strings that happen to
   contain digits.  For example, the string "10" sorts <i>before</i>
   the string "2", for the same reason that "A0" sorts before "B".
   Lexical sorting mean that we compare the strings <i>one
   character at a time</i>, starting at the left end of the string.
   So if the <i>very first character</i> of string A sorts before
   the first character of string B, string A will go before string B,
   even if A has more characters following that make it look like
   a larger number when interpreted as a number.
   Hence "10" goes before "2", simply because "1" sorts before "2".
   The easy way to deal with this is to make sure that digit strings
   used as sort keys are all the same number of digits, using leading zeroes
   if necessary - so "0002" rather than just "2", for example.
