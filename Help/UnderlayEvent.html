<h1>UnderlayEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event type is fired when the program is about to change the
   <a href="Underlay.html">underlay</a> - the image layer displayed
   at the bottom of the screen, under the wheel icons.  PinballY
   checks for a change of underlay image every time a new game is
   selected in the wheel UI, since the underlay image for a game
   depends on its system.  
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   The UnderlayEvent class has only one subtype:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>underlaychange:</b> Fires when the system is about to change
   the underlay as a result of changing the selected game.
   <p>
      There are a couple of subtleties to this event.  First, 
      it only fires when the <i>system</i> initiates an underlay change,
      as part of changing the selected game in the wheel UI.  The event      
      doesn't fire for Javascript-initiated changes.  Second, it only
      fires when the underlay is actually about to change, so it doesn't
      necessarily fire on every new game selection - only those when
      the underlay for the game is different from the one currently
      displayed.  The underlay is considered different if it's a
      different image file, <i>or</i> if any of the display options
      for the current underlay were overridden from the configuration
      defaults.
   </p>
</ul>


<p>
   As with most event types, an UnderlayEvent fires before the system carries
   out its normal handling for the command.  This allows you to block the
   underlay change entirely by calling preventDefault() on the event object in your handler.
   For example, if you simply want to prevent system-triggered underlay changes across the board
   (which you might wish to do if you're creating your own custom way of selecting the
   underlay to use on each game change), you could do this:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("underlaychange", ev => {
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>
<p>
   You can also change the image file that the system loads, if you allow the
   event to proceed.  The <b>filename</b> property of the event object (passed
   as a parameter to your event handler) contains the full filename (with
   directory path and extension) of the image file that the system intends
   to load, as a string.  You can change the property to a new string with
   a different filename, in which case the system will load that file instead.
   For example, this adds an alternating "-blue" or "-red" suffix to the name
   of the file that the system was  planning to load.
</p>
<div class="code">
let suffix = ["-blue$1", "-red$1"];
mainWindow.on("underlaychange", ev => {
    ev.filename = ev.filename.replace(/(\.\w+)$/, suffix[0]);
    suffix.push(suffix.shift());
});
</div>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>filename:</b>  A string giving the full Windows file name (with directory
   path and extension) of the new underlay file that the system has selected for
   the game.  If you change the value of this property, the system will load the
   file you specify in the new value instead of the file it originally planned to load.

   <li><b>game:</b> A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object representing the
   newly selected game that triggered the underlay change.

   <li><b>options:</b>  An object containing overrides for the layout options from
   the configuration.  This is simply set to an empty object when the event initially
   fires.  Event handlers can populate this with properties to override the default
   settings in the configuration, for the underlay display height, bottom offset,
   and so on.  For a list of the properties you can set, see
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#setUnderlay">mainWindow.setUnderlay()</a>.  The
   properties for this object are the same as the properties for the options
   parameter to setUnderlay().
   
</ul>
