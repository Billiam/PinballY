<h1>Button Sounds</h1>

<p>
   You can customize the sound effects played when navigation buttons
   are pressed by supplying your own .WAV files with the sounds you'd
   like to play.
</p>

<h2>Folder location</h2>
<p>
   Startup videos go in the <b>Button Sounds</b> folder within your
   main Media folder.  See <a href="Customizing.html#mediaFolder">Media folder location</a>
   for more on where that folder is located.
</p>

<h2>File types</h2>

<p>
   Button sounds must be .WAV files.
</p>

<h2>Individual button file names</h2>

<p>
   To customize the sound effect for a particular button, just place
   a file in the <b>Button Sounds</b> folder with the name matching
   the button, as shown below.
</p>

<style type="text/css">
.buttonSoundTable td:nth-child(2) {
    text-align: left;
}
</style>
<table class="dataTable buttonSoundTable">
   <tr><th>Filename</th><th>Button Description</th></tr>
   <tr>
      <td>AddCredit.wav</td>
      <td>Coin-in sound when a full credit is added.  See <a href="CoinOptions.html">Coin Options</a>
      for more on how the coin-in buttons are handled, and the distinction between a coin-in event
      that adds a partial credit and one that adds a full credit.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>CoinIn.wav</td>
      <td>Coin-in sound when a partial credit is added</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Deselect.wav</td>
      <td>The "Exit" button, when closing a menu or popup</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Launch.wav</td>
      <td>Played each time a game is launched</td>
   <tr>
      <td>Next.wav</td>
      <td>The "Next" button, moving right through the wheel or to the next menu item</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Prev.wav</td>
      <td>The "Previous" button, moving left through the wheel or to the previous men item</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Select.wav</td>
      <td>The "Select" button: opening a menu, selecting a menu command, opening a popup</td>
   </tr>
</table>
      

<h2>Disabling an individual button sound</h2>

<p>
   If you don't want to hear a sound effect at all when you press a
   particular button, you can simply use a WAV file with a recording
   of an interval of silence for that button's sound file.
</p>
<p>
   For your convenience, we provide a pre-made silent WAV file for
   this purpose.  You'll find the file in the <b>Assets</b> folder
   in your PinballY program folder, under the name <b>Silence.wav</b>.
   Simply copy this file to the Media\Button Sounds folder as
   explained above, and rename it to match the button sound you want
   to suppress.  Repeat that for each button you want to silence.
</p>

<h2>Muting all button sounds</h2>

<p>
   If you just want to disable all of the button sounds across the board, you can
   use the "Mute Buttons" command in the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>.
</p>
