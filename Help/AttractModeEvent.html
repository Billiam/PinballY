<h1>AttractModeEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when the program enters or exits "Attract Mode".
   Attract Mode is the screen saver mode that kicks in after a period of
   time (configurable in the user's option settings) without any button
   input from the user.  In Attract Mode, the system randomly switches
   between games every few seconds.  This serves the dual purposes of
   avoiding "burn-in" (image retention) by ensuring that the same image
   isn't left on the screen for long periods when the machine is idle,
   and adding to the arcade ambiance by making the graphics more dynamic
   when the machine isn't being used.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   There are two subtypes of AttractModeEvent:
<ul>
   <li><b>attractmodestart:</b> Fires when the system is about to enter
   Attract Mode.  This event is cancelable: you can call preventDefault()
   on the event object passed to the handler to prevent the system from
   entering attract mode.  If you cancel the event, the system resets
   the attract mode timer, as though the user had pressed a key.

   <li><b>attractmodeend:</b>  Fires when the system exits attract mode
   due to user input.  This event can't be canceled, as we don't want to
   prevent the user from returning from attract mode.
</ul>

<p>
   These events aren't fired when you start or exit attract mode directly from scripting code via
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#startAttractMode">mainWindow.startAttractMode()</a> or
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#endAttractMode">mainWindow.endAttractMode()</a>,
   respectively.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  It has no additional
   properties beyond the standard set.
