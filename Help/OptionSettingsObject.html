<h1>optionSettings</h1>

<p>
   The optionSettings object provides access to PinballY's option
   settings system, which the program uses to save and restore the
   user's option selections and the program's current state (e.g.,
   which game is selected in the UI and which filter is active).
</p>
<p>
   Options are stored in a file called Settings.txt, stored in the
   program's main install folder.  This file uses a simple name/value
   pair syntax to store arbitrary variables with arbitrary string
   values.  The optionSettings object accesses the in-memory copy
   of this collection of name/value pairs, which constitutes the
   basic database of settings data that PinballY uses throughout
   the program.  
</p>
<p>
   optionSettings provides direct access to the raw settings file
   data.  Be aware that some of this information might be available
   in more processed forms from other system objects, and the
   processed versions might be easier to use for most purposes.
   For example, for information on what's currently showing
   in the wheel UI, you'll probably want to use the
   <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object instead of the
   raw settings data; for information on player systems, 
   <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> objects are
   usually easier to use than the raw system setting variables.
</p>
<p>
   The settings system's name/value pair scheme is arbitrarily extensible.
   There's no pre-defined set of names that you're limited to, so you can
   define new variables of your own if you want to store additional
   settings beyond what the system stores.  Just be sure to use
   suitably unique names for any new custom variables you add,
   to avoid any conflicts with future system variables.  It's a
   good idea to use long names with some kind of prefix that
   signifies that the variables are custom - use your name as a
   prefix, perhaps.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   optionSettings is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), etc) to add and remove event listeners.
   See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   This object serves as the event target for the following event
   types, which represent events related to saving and reloading
   the settings file:
</p>
<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="optionSettings"></div>


<h2>Variable names</h2>
<p>
   Every option setting is represented by a name/value pair, which
   we refer to as a "variable", in the same sense as a program variable
   in a language like Javascript or C++.  Variable names are arbitrary
   strings of alphanumeric characters and a limited set of punctuation
   characters, including "." and "_".
</p>
<p>All variable names are "global": all of the names share a single
   namespace with no nesting or hierarchy structure, so every variable's
   name has to be unique.  The system uses a convention of "dotted"
   prefixes for related variables (e.g., all of the capture-related
   settings start with "Capture."), but be aware that there's no actual
   formal structure to this.  The "." characters in the dotted names are
   just parts of the names, the same as any alphabetic characters would
   be, and aren't some kind of namespace qualifier syntax.
</p>
<p>
   If you add new custom variables of your own, it's a good idea to
   use some kind of prefix to ensure uniqueness, since all variables
   have to share a common namespace.  A prefix based on your name or
   the name of the package/feature you're developing can be helpful
   to keep track of which variable goes with which code.
</p>

<h2>Variable types</h2>
<p>
   All settings variables are stored as string values in the file.
   There are no other "datatypes" besides strings, as far as the file
   storage is concerned.
</p>
<p>
   However, it's convenient to be able to interpret some variables
   as numbers, some as boolean values, etc, depending on how they're
   used.  To help with that, the settings system can automatically
   perform conversions to and from several native types when reading
   and writing variable values:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li>string (the actual storage format)
   <li>boolean
   <li>integer
   <li>floating point number
   <li>RECT (the Windows API rectangle structure)
</ul>
<p>
   When reading values, you can use the "get" methods for the
   various datatypes to read values with specific types.  When
   writing values, you always use the same "set" method, and the
   system figures out how to format the value as a string for
   storage in the file.
</p>
<p>
   Be aware the actual value stored in the file is <i>always</i> a
   string value.  When you use the get/set methods to convert to and
   from native types other than strings, the system performs the
   conversion with reference to the string stored in the file.  Also
   be aware that the proper type interpretation of a particular variable
   is up to you when you read or write the variable, since the system
   doesn't store the original type in the file.  If you store a value
   as a "float" and read it back as an "int", the system will happily
   comply, but you'll naturally lose any fractional part of the
   original floating point value.
</p>

<h2>Effects of changing a variable</h2>

<p>
   In some cases, changing the value of a system-defined setting variable
   will cause an immediate effect in the UI, because the system refers
   directly to the in-memory settings variables for some purposes.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, though, changing a variable won't have any effect
   until the settings file is saved and reloaded.  This is because
   the system creates a number of objects <i>based on</i> the settings
   information when it loads the settings, and then uses those separate
   objects for ongoing operations.  For example, the system creates an
   internal object to represent each player system at startup, and
   uses these objects for operations related to the systems, such
   as launching a game or finding its media files.  Changing the
   settings variables for a player system thus has no immediate effect
   on things like game launching or media file loading.
</p>
<p>
   The way to force settings changes to take effect in the UI is
   to save and reload the file.  Saving the file writes out all of
   the in-memory changes to the file on disk, and reloading it
   forces the system to re-create all of the internal objects that
   it builds based on the settings data.  See the
   <a href="#save"><b>save()</b></a> and <a href="#reload"><b>reload</b></a>
   methods below for details.  Note that reloading has a number of
   visible side effects, such as interrupting video playback, so
   it's best to do this only in response to an explicit user action,
   preferably one that's significant enough from a user's
   perspective to justify a UI refresh.  For example, the
   system reloads settings when the user clicks the Apply or OK
   button in the settings dialog.

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   <a name="filename"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.filename:</b>  The name of the settings file,
   with full directory path.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="get"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.get(<i>name</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>):</b>  Get the
   value of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i>.  Returns
   the value as a string; this is the way it's actually stored in the
   settings file, so this is the most direct, unprocessed way to access the
   original value.  If the variable isn't defined in the settings,
   <i>defaultValue</i> is returned instead.  (If you omit the <i>defaultValue</i>
   argument, <b>undefined</b> is used instead per the normal Javascript rules.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getBool"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.getBool(<i>name</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>):</b>  Get the
   value of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i>, interpreting
   it as a boolean (true/false) value and returning the result as a Javascript
   boolean.  If the variable isn't defined in the settings,
   <i>defaultValue</i> is returned instead.  (If you omit the <i>defaultValue</i>
   argument, <b>undefined</b> is used instead per the normal Javascript rules.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getFloat"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.getFloat(<i>name</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>):</b>  Get the
   value of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i>, interpreting
   it as a floating point value and returning the result as a Javascript number.
   If the variable isn't defined in the settings, <i>defaultValue</i> is
   returned instead.  (If you omit the <i>defaultValue</i> argument,
   <b>undefined</b> is used instead per the normal Javascript rules.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getInt"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.getInt(<i>name</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>):</b>  Get the
   value of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i>, interpreting
   it as an integer value and returning the result as a Javascript number.
   If the variable isn't defined in the settings, <i>defaultValue</i> is
   returned instead.  (If you omit the <i>defaultValue</i> argument,
   <b>undefined</b> is used instead per the normal Javascript rules.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getFloat"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.getRect(<i>name</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>):</b>  Get the
   value of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i>, interpreting
   it as a Windows RECT (rectangle) structure, and returning the result as
   a Javascript object, with properties {<b>left:</b> <i>integer</i>,
   <b>top:</b> <i>integer</i>, <b>right:</b> <i>integer</i>, <b>bottom:</b> <i>integer</i>}.
   These properties give the of the top/left and bottom/right
   corners of the rectangle, as integer pixel offsets (the origin of
   the coordinate system depends on context, since the RECT structure
   can be used to represent screen coordinates in pixels, window coordinates, etc).
   If the variable isn't defined in the settings, <i>defaultValue</i> is
   returned instead.  (If you omit the <i>defaultValue</i> argument,
   <b>undefined</b> is used instead per the normal Javascript rules.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="isDirty"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.isDirty():</b>  Returns true if the in-memory settings
   have any unsaved changes, false if not.  Any change made through <b>set()</b>
   updates the in-memory copy, but doesn't immediately write the changes to
   the disk file.  The same applies to changes made by the system itself
   that haven't been saved yet.  In either case, the internal "dirty"
   flag is set to indicate that the in-memory copy has unsaved changes.
   This method lets you test that flag to determine if any changes
   have been made (from Javascript code or by the system) since the last
   time the file was saved or loaded.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="set"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.reload():</b>  Reloads the settings file.  Any unsaved
   changes to the in-memory copy are discarded, and replaced with the values
   from the file on disk.  Note that the system automatically reloads the
   settings file when the user makes changes through the options dialog.
   Reloading the settings file has the side effect of reloading the XML
   game database files and rescanning all system table folders, since
   changes to the settings can affect which systems are active, which
   folders are scanned for games, where the database files are located,
   and where the media files are located.  Any media currently being
   displayed are reloaded, so any playing video will be reloaded and
   restarted.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to force settings changes that you've made via <b>set()</b>
   to take effect in the UI, save the updates calling <b>save()</b>, then
   load the updated file via <b>reload()</b>.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="set"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.save():</b>  Saves the current in-memory settings
   variables to the disk file, and clears the "dirty" flag.  Returns true
   if the file write operation was successful, false if an error occurred.
   (The system itself doesn't show any messages if an error occurs; it
   just returns that information to you via the result value.)
</p>

<p>
   <a name="set"></a>
   <b>optionSettings.set(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>):</b>  Set the value
   of the settings variable named by the string <i>name</i> to the
   value given by <i>value</i>.  <i>value</i> can be one of the following
   types:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>undefined: the variable is erased from the settings
   <li>null: the variable is erased from the settings
   <li>string: the value is stored exactly as given
   <li>number: the value is stored as a string representation of its
   numeric value, as a decimal integer or decimal floating point value
   <li>boolean: the value is stored as the string "0" or "1"
   <li>object: if the value looks like a RECT struct (with properties
   left, top, right, and bottom), it's stored as "left,top,right,bottom",
   with the decimal integer values of each coordinate; otherwise, an error
   is thrown
</ul>
