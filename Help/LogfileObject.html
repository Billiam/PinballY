<h1>logfile Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>logfile</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object that lets you
   write messages to the program's log file.  This can be helpful
   for debugging purposes, as a quick way to verify that a particular
   function is being called, an event is occurring, etc.  For
   more on debugging in general, see <a href="JsDebug.html">Javascript
   debugging</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The log is a text
   file named <b>PinballY.log</b>, located in the main PinballY
   program folder.  PinballY automatically creates this file
   each time you run the program, and writes miscellaneous
   status messages to the file throughout the session.  The
   log file is mostly for troubleshooting purposes; it has
   details on what the program was attempting to do, such as
   which directories it scanned for games and media files, what
   happened when it tried to load various external DLLs or
   access third-party programs, etc.  You can control which
   types of status messages the system writes to the file
   via the program's main Options dialog.
</p>
<p>
   Any messages you write from Javascript via the logfile object
   are included in the file unconditionally.  There are no option
   settings that will disable your scripting messages.  (The
   "Javascript" option in the dialog only controls whether or
   not Javascript-related messages generated by the system itself
   are included; it doesn't affect your script-generated messages.)
</p>
   

<h2>Methods</h2>

<a name="log"></a>
<p>
   <b>logfile.log(<i>object</i>, ...):</b>  Converts all of the arguments
   to string values using normal Javascript rules, and writes the
   strings to the log file, separated by spaces.  A newline is
   appended at the end of the text.
</p>
<p>
   <b>logfile.log(<i>formatString</i>, ...):</b>  If the first argument
   to logfile.log() is a string, and it contains one or more "printf"-style
   "%" format codes, logfile.log() interprets it as a format string with
   substitution variables.  Each "%" code is replaced with a formatted
   version of the corresponding argument from the <i>arguments</i> list,
   in left-to-right order.  This uses the same formatting rules as
   <a href="ConsoleObject.html#sprintfLog">console.log()</a>.
