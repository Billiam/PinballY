<h1>Status Line Options</h1>
<p>
   The "status line" is the area at the bottom of the main playfield
   window where text messages are displayed.  This dialog lets you
   customize what's displayed there.
</p>
<p>
   There are actually two lines of text shown in the status area, an
   "upper" and "lower" status line.  You can program separate custom
   messages into each line.
</p>
<h2>Message text</h2>
<p>
   Enter the messages to display in the text boxes.  Enter multiple
   messages by writing one message per line (press the Return key
   to start a new line).  Messages are shown in a loop in the order
   they're entered in the text box.
</p>

<h3>Substitution variables</h3>
<p>
   Within the text of each message, you can use a number of
   "substitution variables".  These are special tags that are
   replaced at run-time with current information, such as
   information about the current selected game or the game
   filter that's currently in use.
</p>
<table>
   <tr><td>[Game.Title]</td><td>The title of the currently selected game</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Game.Manuf]</td><td>The current game's manufacturer (Williams, Gottlieb, etc)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Game.Year]</td><td>Year of release of the original arcade version current game</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Game.System]</td><td>Name of the current game's player system (Visual Pinball, etc)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Filter.Title]</td><td>Name of the current game filter (All Tables, 70s Tables, etc)</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Filter.Count]</td><td>Number of games matching the current filter</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Filter.Count:A:B:C]</td><td>Displays "A" if the filter count is 1, "B" if it's greater than 1, or "C" if it's zero</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Credits]</td><td>Current number of credits from inserted coins</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[Credits.Count:A:B:C]</td><td>Displays "A" if the credit count is 1, "B" if it's greater than 1, or "C" if it's zero</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[lb]</td><td>A literal left square bracket ("[")</td></tr>
   <tr><td>[rb]</td><td>A literal right square bracket ("]")</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
   The special ".Count:A:B:C" formats can be used to construct singular
   or plural forms to match one of the counters.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
    [Filter.Count] [Filter.Count:Game:Games] Selected
</pre>
<p>
   The second element translates to "Game" or "Games" as needed to
   match the count, so the overall messages would translate to
   "1 Game Selected", "2 Games Selected", and so on.  The point is
   simply to make the wording more human-friendly by matching the
   singular and plural form to the actual number.
</p>
<p>
   Note that we only specified two ":" alternatives in the example,
   not three.  The third alternative is for the "zero" case, but in
   English, you can simply use the plural form with zero
   ("0 Games Selected" sounds right to most English speakers).
   If you omit the third ":" alternative, the system uses the plural
   form for zero.  That saves you a little typing, but you could
   equally well have spelled it out in full:
</p>
<pre>
    [Filter.Count] [Filter.Count:Game:Games:Games] Selected
</pre>

<h2>Message switch time</h2>
<p>
   The switching time sets the length of time each individual message
   is displayed before switching to the next message.  This is given
   in milliseconds.  A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second; 1000
   milliseconds equals one second.
