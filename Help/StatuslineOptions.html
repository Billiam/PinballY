<h1>Status Line Options</h1>
<p>
   The "status line" is the area at the bottom of the main playfield
   window where text messages are displayed.  This dialog lets you
   customize what's displayed there.
</p>
<p>
   There are actually two lines of text shown in the status area, an
   "upper" and "lower" status line.  You can program separate custom
   messages into each line.
</p>
<h2>Message text</h2>
<p>
   Enter the messages to display in the text boxes.  Enter multiple
   messages by writing one message per line (press the Return key
   to start a new line).  Messages are shown in a loop in the order
   they're entered in the text box.
</p>

<a name="substVars"></a>
<h3>Substitution variables</h3>
<p>
   Within the text of each message, you can use a number of
   "substitution variables".  These are special tags that are
   replaced at run-time with current information, such as
   information about the current selected game or the game
   filter that's currently in use.
</p>

<h4>Singular/plural formats</h4>
<p>
   The special "xxx:A:B:C" formats can be used to construct singular
   or plural forms to match one of the counters.  For example:
</p>
<pre>
    [Filter.Count] [Filter.Count:Game:Games] Selected
</pre>
<p>
   The second element translates to "Game" or "Games" as needed to
   match the count, so the overall messages would translate to
   "1 Game Selected", "2 Games Selected", and so on.  This lets
   you get the wording right to match singular and plural words to
   the live number, to avoid sloppy phrasing like "1 Games Selected"
   or the standard lazy hedge "1 Game(s) Selected".
</p>
<p>
   You can specify either two or three ":" alternatives.
   The third alternative, if present, is a special case for 0 (zero).
   If you only provide two alternatives, the second (plural) form
   is used for zero by default.  That's because English usually
   uses the plural for for zero, as in "0 Games Selected".
   If you want to specify a different form for zero, or you
   just want to make it explicit, you can add a third ":" case:
</p>
<pre>
    [Filter.Count] [Filter.Count:Game:Games:Games] Selected
</pre>

<h4>Date/time formats</h4>
<p>
   For date variables ([Game.LastPlayed]), you can specify a custom
   format for the display by adding a format string following a ":".
   The format string uses the C strftime() codes, where elements of
   the date and time are represented by % codes in the string.  The
   codes are listed in the table below.  Any other text (apart from
   the % codes) is left unchanged, so you can mix in punctuation
   (such as commas or slashes) or other fixed text without any special
   codes.  You can find more complete documentation for strftime() in
   the Microsoft Visual C++ reference materials online.
</p>
<p>
   For example, [Game.LastPlayed:%A, %B %#e, %Y] might translate to
   "Thursday, May 2, 2019".
</p>
<p>
   Note that if you want to use a vertical bar or right square bracket
   in the format string, you must write it "%/" (for a bar) or
   "%)" (for a right square bracket), because otherwise PinballY will
   interpret it as the end of the format string.
<p>
   In addition to the date format string, you can specify custom text
   to display when there's no date at all, such as when using
   [Game.LastPlayed] with a game that's never been played.  Specify
   this using a vertical bar, "|", followed by the custom text.
   The only special format codes in this section are %) for a right
   square bracket and %% for a single percent sign; otherwise, the text
   is displayed exactly as written.  To extend our example above
   to add the custom text "Never Played" for a game with no "last played"
   date, we could write [Game.LastPlayed:%A, %B %#e, %Y|Never Played].
   If you omit this extra custom text, the system provides default text
   (such as "Never").

   Removing leading spaces or zeroes:  you can add a # character between
   the % and the format character to remove any leading space or zero
   character, if present.  For example, %#e yields the day of the month
   with no leading space if it's a single-digit day.

<h2>Message switch time</h2>
<p>
   The switching time sets the length of time each individual message
   is displayed before switching to the next message.  This is given
   in milliseconds.  A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second; 1000
   milliseconds equals one second.
