<h1>Commands</h1>

<p>
   Many of PinballY's program functions are accessible as "commands".
   A command is an operation that can be triggered by the user via an
   action in the UI, usually by selecting an item
   from a menu.  Commands can sometimes be triggered directly by pressing
   a button, but most buttons are mapped to navigation controls that only
   operate the menus rather than triggering commands directly.  Commands
   are also sometimes used for internal event sequencing, such as handling
   the events involved in starting or exiting a game.
</p>
<p>
   The concept of commands is important in the Javascript context in two
   ways.  The first is that each time a user action (such as a button
   press or a menu selection) triggers a command, a Javascript
   <a href="CommandEvent.html">Command Event</a> is fired.  This notifies
   your scripting code that a command is being executed, lets it know
   which one, and gives it a chance to intervene.   Your event handler
   can cancel the command, carry out some additional operation along
   with the command, or perform some other action instead of
   the command.  The second way that commands are important to Javascript
   is that you can intentionally trigger a command from a script, as
   though the user had selected the command from a menu.  You do this by calling
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doCommand">mainWindow.doCommand()</a>.
</p>

<a name="commandIDs"></a>
<h2>Command IDs</h2>

<p>
   Each available command action is identified by an integer command code.
   This might seem a little primitive or opaque, but we do it this way
   because it's the Windows convention for associating commands with
   window menus.  PinballY uses normal window menus in addition to its
   own graphical menu system, so we chose a command representation
   that's compatible with the native Windows APIs.
</p>
<p>
   To make your Javascript code more readable, the
   system pre-defines named symbols for the command codes, so that you
   can refer to the commands by name in your code rather than by
   number.  All of the command codes are defined as properties of
   the global <b>command</b> object, so you refer to each one as <b>command.<i>commandName</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
   You can also do the reverse lookup.  That is, given a numeric command
   ID, you can find its name - the name of the property for that ID in the
   <b>command</b> object - via <b>command.name(<i>id</i>)</b>.  That will give you a
   string with the corresponding <b>command</b> property name.
</p>

<a name="userCommandIDs"></a>
<h2>User command IDs</h2>

<p>
   The system reserves a range of identifiers for user-defined commands:
   command.UserFirst to command.UserLast.  The system doesn't use any of
   these internally, so you can safely use any value in this range to
   identify your own commands, such as when creating custom menus.
</p>
<p>
   The best way to define your own command IDs is to use the
   <a href="#allocate">command.allocate()</a> function to dynamically
   allocate an ID for each command.  This assigns a new ID, and records
   it as in use within the command object, to guarantee that each call
   to command.allocate() yields a different ID.  IDs are assigned
   starting with command.UserLast and with each new ID one less than
   the previous one.
</p>
<p>
   The number of available user-defined IDs is finite, so you should
   allocate an ID for each unique command you need during startup, and
   then use those assigned numbers throughout the session.
</p>
<p>
   The advantage of using command.allocate() to
   assign IDs, rather than defining IDs on an ad hoc basis in your
   code, is that it helps ensure that different modules written by
   different people can be safely mixed together on one system.  As
   long as each module assigns any commands it needs via this function,
   each module will get its own separate commands, so there will be
   no conflict about the meaning of a given user command ID.
</p>
<p>
   Don't save command IDs in external files or settings, since
   there's no guarantee that the ID numbers will be the same from
   one session to the next.  
</p>

<a name="systemCommandIDs"></a>
<h2>System command IDs</h2>
<p>
   The pre-defined system command names are listed below.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="AboutBox"></a>
   <b>command.AboutBox:</b>  Display the program's About Box, as a graphic
   overlay in the main playfield window.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="AddFavorite"></a>
   <b>command.AddFavorite:</b>  Add the current game to the Favorites list.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="AdjustCaptureDelay"></a>
   <b>command.AdjustCaptureDelay:</b>  Displays the dialog to adjust the
   media capture startup delay time.  This is normally only shown in the
   course of the capture setup procedure.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="AdjustAudioVolume"></a>
   <b>command.AdjustAudioVolume:</b>  Displays the audio volume adjustment
   dialog, which sets the per-game audio attenuation level for background
   videos and table audio tracks.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureAll"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureAll:</b>  Activates "step 2" of the batch capture
   setup workflow, specifying that all games are to be included in the batch.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureFilter"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureFilter:</b>  Activates "step 2" of the batch capture
   setup workflow, specifying that games selected by the current filter are
   to be included in the batch.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureGo"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureGo:</b>  Executes the batch capture, using the
   settings entered during the setup workflow process.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureMarked"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureMarked:</b>  Activates "step 2" of the batch capture
   setup workflow, specifying that the batch should consist of the games manually
   marked for capture.  Step 2 displays a menu letting the user select the
   media types to include in the capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureStep1"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureStep1:</b>  Initiates the batch capture setup workflow.
   This is the command that the user selects from the game setup menu to initiate
   a batch capture.  The batch capture setup process consists of a workflow that
   steps the user through a series of menus to select options for the capture.
   The immediate effect of this command is to display the first menu in that
   workflow, so this command doesn't actually initiate a batch capture, but
   rather starts the UI workflow to set up the options.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureStep3"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureStep3:</b>  Activates "step 3" of the batch capture
   setup workflow.  Step 3 displays a menu letting user select the treatment
   of existing files (replace or keep) for each media type to be included
   in the capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureStep4"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureStep4:</b>  Activates "step 4" of the batch capture
   setup workflow.  Step 4 displays a summary of the items to be captured,
   and presents menu options to view the full capture details and to launch
   the capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="BatchCaptureView"></a>
   <b>command.BatchCaptureView:</b>  Displays a detailed list of the games
   and media items selected for the batch capture.  This is offered as a menu
   option on the last step of the batch capture setup workflow, to let the user
   view the detailed work list before launching the capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="CaptureFirst"></a>
   <a name="CaptureLast"></a>
   <b>command.CaptureFirst ... command.CaptureLast:</b>  These commands are
   used during the capture setup workflow to refer to the individual media
   types in the capture.  Activating the command advances the selection
   state of the associated media type: for example, it might change the
   selection state of "Playfield Image" from "Capture" to "Skip".  The
   media type associated with each index in this range isn't fixed; it's
   determined by the set of media types the user selects during earlier
   steps in the capture workflow.  And the range of selection options is
   likewise variable at run-time, as it depends on which media subtype
   is involved (video, image, audio), whether or not there are existing
   files of the type, and whether this is a single or batch capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="CaptureGo"></a>
   <b>command.CaptureGo:</b>  Launches a single-game media capture.  In the
   user interface, this command is offered from the final menu of the
   capture setup workflow.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="CaptureLayoutSkip"></a>
   <b>command.CaptureLayoutSkip:</b>  When you start a capture, PinballY
   shows a message explaining how the PinballY window layout determines
   the screen capture area, and shows a menu with options to proceed or
   cancel.  This command is used for an additional item lets the user
   "Skip this message from now on".  Selecting this command toggles a
   config variable (Capture.SkipLayoutMessage).
</p>

<p>
   <a name="CaptureLayoutOk"></a>
   <b>command.CaptureLayoutOk:</b>  Acknowledges the message shown at
   the start of a capture about how the PinballY window layout determines
   the screen recording area.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="CaptureMediaSetup"></a>
   <b>command.CaptureMediaSetup:</b>  Displays the capture media setup menu.
   This starts the single-game media capture workflow; it's offered as an
   option in the UI from the game setup menu.  This command doesn't
   actually launch a media capture operation, but rather begins the UI
   workflow to set up a capture.  The immediate effect of the command is
   to display the capture setup menu.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="ClearCredits"></a>
   <b>command.ClearCredits:</b>  Zeroes the coin credit counters.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="ConfirmDeleteGameInfo"></a>
   <b>command.ConfirmDeleteGameInfo:</b>  This command appears in the UI
   as an option on the "Confirm Delete Game Information" menu, to let the user confirm
   that they really want to delete the game data.  This command carries
   out the deletion of the current game's information in the XML
   table database file.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="DeleteGameInfo"></a>
   <b>command.DeleteGameInfo:</b>  This command displays the "Confirm Delete
   Game Information" menu, which asks the user to confirm that they wish
   to delete the current game's XML data from the table database.  This
   command doesn't actually perform the deletion; it just shows the menu
   to prompt the user for confirmation.  If the user does confirm the
   operation through that menu, the menu will trigger a ConfirmDeleteGameInfo
   command to actually carry out the deletion.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="DeleteMediaFile"></a>
   <b>command.DeleteMediaFile:</b>  Deletes the currently selected media
   file for the current game.  The file must be selected first via the
   media viewer dialog.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="EditCategories"></a>
   <b>command.EditCategories:</b>  Displays the category editor dialog,
   allowing the user to add, remove, and rename category tags.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="EditGameInfo"></a>
   <b>command.EditGameInfo:</b>  Displays the game information editor
   dialog, allowing the user to create or modify the XML table database
   information (title, year, manufacturer, system, etc) for the current
   game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="EnableVideos"></a>
   <b>command.EnableVideos:</b>  Toggles the global "enable videos"
   setting.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByAdded"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByAdded:</b>  Displays a menu showing options for
   all of the filters that select for when a game was added to the
   database.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByCategory"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByCategory:</b>  Displays a menu showing options
   for all of the filters that select games by category.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByEra"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByEra:</b>  Displays a menu showing options for
   all of the filters that select games by release date.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByManufacturer"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByManufacturer:</b>  Displays a menu showing
   options for all of the filters that select games by manufacturer.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByRating"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByRating:</b>  Displays a menu showing options
   for all of the filters that select games by "star" ratings.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterByRecency"></a>
   <b>command.FilterByRecency:</b>  Displays a menu showing options
   for all of the filters that select a game by how recently they
   were played.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterBySystem"></a>
   <b>command.FilterBySystem:</b>  Displays a menu showing options
   for all of the filters that select a game by simulator system.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FilterFirst"></a>
   <a name="FilterLast"></a>
   <b>command.FilterFirst ... command.FilterLast:</b>  The commands
   in this range select individual filters.  The menus shown by the
   "Filter By Xxx" commands all consist of commands in this range,
   to select specific filters.  The system assigns a unique command
   ID in this range to each filter during startup.  The ID assigned
   to a given filter can vary from session to session, because the
   overall collection of filters depends on the game database.
   For example, there's one filter per manufacturer found in the
   database, so the number of manufacturer filters depends on how
   many unique manufacturers are in the user's database, and can
   even change during the session if the user adds games with
   new manufacturers through the game information editor.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="FindMediaGo"></a>
   <b>command.FindMediaGo:</b>  Launches a media search operation
   for the current game, which opens an external browser window
   and navigates to a Google search page with a pre-built search term
   designed to find HyperPin Media Pack files for the current game,
   using the game's metadata to fill in the search details.   
   In the UI, this command is accessed from the Media Search menu,
   which is displayed via the ShowFindMediaMenu command.  
</p>

<p>
   <a name="Flyer"></a>
   <b>command.Flyer:</b>  Displays the current game's flyer
   graphics, if available, as an overlay in the main window.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="GameInfo"></a>
   <b>command.GameInfo:</b>  Displays an overlay in the main window
   with details on the current game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="Help"></a>
   <b>command.Help:</b>  Displays the PinballY help file, by opening
   an external Web browser window and navigating to the table of
   contents page.  The help files are local HTML files within the
   PinballY folder, so this simply navigates to a file:/// URL
   selecting the main h elp file.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="HideGame"></a>
   <b>command.HideGame:</b>  Toggles the "hidden" status for the
   current game.  A hidden game is excluded by all filters except
   for the special "hidden games" filter, so hiding a game allows
   a user to exclude a non-playable game (e.g., an old version,
   a backup copy, etc) from the normal UI without actually deleting
   any of the files involved.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="HideWindow"></a>
   <b>command.HideWindow:</b>  Hides the current foreground window.
   The window's Javascript object still exists, but the on-screen
   window is hidden and can't receive any keyboard or other input
   events.  From the user's perspective, the window is effectively
   closed.  This command has no effect on the playfield window,
   since that window holds the main UI.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="HighScores"></a>
   <b>command.HighScores:</b>  Displays an overlay showing the
   high score information for the current game, if available.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="Instructions"></a>
   <b>command.Instructions:</b>  Displays an overlay showing the
   instruction card for the current game, if available.  The overlay
   appears as a popup in the main window, backglass window, or
   topper window, according to the option settings.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="KillGame"></a>
   <b>command.KillGame:</b>  If a game is running, this attempts to
   terminate the game and make PinballY the foreground application.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MarkForBatchCapture"></a>
   <b>command.MarkForBatchCapture:</b>  Toggles the current game's
   "marked for batch capture" status.  One of the options in the
   batch capture process for selecting which games to include is
   to include games marked with this status, so this gives the
   user a way to construct an ad hoc set of games to include in
   a capture.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MediaDropFirst"></a>
   <a name="MediaDropLast"></a>
   <b>command.MediaDropFirst ... command.MediaDropLast:</b>
   The commands in this range represent the individual entries
   in a set of media files involved in a drag-and-drop operation,
   where the user has dragged files from the Windows desktop
   and dropped them onto a PinballY window for the purposes of
   installing the files as media for the current games.  Each
   file in the drop set is assigned a unique ID within this
   range, with the first file assigned the ID MediaDropFirst,
   and each additional file getting the next higher ID.
   These commands are used in "step 2" of the media drop workflow,
   which displays an option for the disposition (add, skip,
   replace) for each file in the group of files dropped.  The
   effect of each of these commands when executed is to toggle
   to the next disposition for the item.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MediaDropGo"></a>
   <b>command.MediaDropGo:</b>  Executes the current media
   drop operation, installing the dropped files according to
   the selections made in the media drop menu workflow.  In
   the UI, this is offered as a command in the final step
   of the workflow, to confirm that the file installation
   should proceed.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MediaDropPhase2"></a>
   <b>command.MediaDropPhase2:</b>  Initiates "step 2" of the
   media drop workflow, which displays a menu showing the items
   to be dropped, allowing the user to select a disposition
   (add, skip, replace) for each item.  The available
   dispositions depend upon whether or not the game already
   has an existing file of the same type.  Each file in the
   drop set is assigned a command ID in the range
   MediaDropFirst to MediaDropLast, and each of these
   commands is used to let the user select which disposition
   to use for each file.  Note that "step 2" is normally
   initiated by "step 1", which is triggered not by a
   regular menu command but by a mouse drag-and-drop
   operation.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MenuPageDown"></a>
   <b>command.MenuPageDown:</b>  If a menu is being displayed,
   and the menu has a section of items that's divided into multiple
   pages (because there are too many items in the section to show
   all at once), this advances to the next group of items in
   the menu.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MenuPageUp"></a>
   <b>command.MenuPageUp:</b>  If a multi-page menu is being
   displayed, this moves to the prior page of items in the menu.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MenuReturn"></a>
   <b>command.MenuReturn:</b>  Cancel the current menu and return
   to the previous UI mode.  This is the command associated with the
   "Cancel" or "Return" items that appear in most menus.  The Exit
   button also triggers this command when a menu is showing, unless
   the menu is designated as an Exit Menu and the option to treat
   the Exit button as the Select button in an Exit menu is set.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MirrorWindowHorz"></a>
   <b>command.MirrorWindowHorz:</b>  Mirrors the current foreground
   window's graphics contents left-to-right.  This produces a display
   as though you were viewing the window in a mirror held up to one
   side of the window.  The window's caption bar and frame controls aren't
   affected by this, since the Windows desktop UI isn't capable of
   applying these sorts of transformations to window frames.  Mirroring
   can be useful if you have physical display setup where you're viewing
   one of your monitors as a reflection in a mirror, which is sometimes
   the case in video game cabinets.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="MirrorWindowVert"></a>
   <b>command.MirrorWindowVert:</b>  Mirrors the current foreground
   window's graphics contents to-to-bottom.  This produces a display
   as though you were viewing the window in a mirror held up to the
   top or bottom edge of the window.  The window's caption bar and frame
   controls aren't affected by this, since the Windows desktop UI isn't
   capable of applying these sorts of transformations to window frames.
   Mirroring can be useful if you have a physical display setup where
   you're viewing one of your monitors as a reflection in a mirror,
   which is sometimes the case in video game cabinets.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MuteAttractMode"></a>
   <b>command.MuteAttractMode:</b>  Toggles the "mute attract mode"
   option setting, which controls whether or not sound effects are
   muted when attract mode is active.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MuteButtons"></a>
   <b>command.MuteButtons:</b>  Toggles the "mute buttons" setting,
   which controls whether or not button sound effects are played.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MuteTableAudio"></a>
   <b>command.MuteTableAudio:</b>  Toggles the "mute table audio"
   setting, which controls whether or not table audio files are
   played.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="MuteVideos"></a>
   <b>command.MuteVideos:</b>  Toggles the "mute videos" setting,
   which controls whether or not the audio portion of a table's
   video file is played.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="Options"></a>
   <b>command.Options:</b>  Displays the Options dialog.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PauseGame"></a>
   <b>command.PauseGame:</b>  If a game is running, this attempts to
   bring the main PinballY window to the foreground.  Despite the
   name, this doesn't attempt to send the game any explicit commands
   to pause, since none of the popular game systems have anything
   like that.  Instead, it depends upon the game recognizing loss
   of window activation as meaning it should pause, which the
   popular systems happen to do.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PinscapeNightMode"></a>
   <b>command.PinscapeNightMode:</b>  If a Pinscape unit has been
   detected, this sends a "toggle night mode" command to the device.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PickSysFirst"></a>
   <a name="PickSysLast"></a>
   <b>command.PickSysFirst ... command.PickSysLast:</b>  These
   commands are used in the "Pick a system" menu, which is displayed
   if the user tries to launch a game that doesn't have an XML
   database entry, and whose file type is associated with more than
   one system.  The program can't infer which game system to use in
   this case, so it asks the user by displaying a menu.  Each
   matching system is assigned a unique command ID from this
   range; executing one of these command IDs has the effect of
   launching the game using the assigned system.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PlayGame"></a>
   <b>command.PlayGame:</b>  Launch the current game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PowerOff"></a>
   <b>command.PowerOff:</b>  This command is triggered when the user selects
   "Shutdown" from the Exit menu.  It doesn't actually shut down the system;
   it just shows the shutdown confirmation menu, which asks the user to
   confirm the action before proceeding.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="PowerOffConfirm"></a>
   <b>command.PowerOffConfirm:</b>  This command is triggered when the user
   selects the "Yes, I really want to shut down the system now" option from the
   shutdown confirmation menu.  This command proceeds by asking Windows to
   power off the system.  Assuming that Windows allows the shutdown request,
   this will have the side effect of terminating the program shortly after
   the power-off command.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="Quit"></a>
   <b>command.Quit:</b>  Exits the program.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RateGame"></a>
   <b>command.RateGame:</b>  Displays the Rate Game dialog, allowing the
   user to enter a "star" rating for the current game interactively.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RemoveFavorite"></a>
   <b>command.RemoveFavorite:</b>  Removes the current game from the
   Favorites list.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RestartAsAdmin"></a>
   <b>command.RestartAsAdmin:</b>  Re-launches the program under the
   Admin Host program.  This is normally used when a game launch fails
   because it requires admin privileges, and the user selects this
   option to restart the session using the Admin Host.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="ResumeGame"></a>
   <b>command.ResumeGame:</b>  If a game is running, attempts to make the
   game the foreground application, which should return keyboard focus to
   the game and make it resume normal play.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RealDmdAutoEnable"></a>
   <b>command.RealDmdAutoEnable:</b>  Sets the Real DMD status
   to "Automatic", which means that the program will enable the DMD if
   the DMD DLL can be loaded.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RealDmdDisable"></a>
   <b>command.RealDmdDisable:</b>  Disables PinballY's Real DMD usage,
   which prevents PinballY from attempting to load the DMD DLL or access
   the device.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="RealDmdEnable"></a>
   <b>command.RealDmdEnable:</b>  Enables PinballY's DMD usage.  This
   tells PinballY that a DMD device is definitely present, so PinballY
   attempts to load the DMD DLL and connect to the device at startup.
   The difference between "Enabled" and "Automatic" is that PinballY
   will display an error message in "Enabled" mode if the DMD can't
   be accessed, since you've asserted that the device is definitely
   present and that you definitely want PinballY to use it; whereas
   there's no error in "Automatic" mode, since that mode means that
   you want PinballY to determine whether or not a DMD is present,
   and it's not an error condition if the answer is "no".

   <a name="RotateWindowCCW"></a>
   <b>command.RotateWindowCCW:</b>  Rotates the current foreground window's
   graphics contents counter-clockwise (CCW) by 90 degrees.  This only rotates the
   contents of the window, since the Windows desktop UI isn't capable of rotating
   window frames, so the on-screen boundaries of the window aren't affected.

<p>
   <a name="RotateWindowCW"></a>
   <b>command.RotateWindowCW:</b>  Rotates the current foreground window's
   graphics contents clockwise (CW) by 90 degrees.  This only rotates the

   <b>command.UserFirst ... command.UserLast: </b>  This is a range of
   commands reserved for user-written Javascript commands, mainly for
   use in <a href="Menus.html">custom menus</a>.  The system doesn't
   generate any of these commands itself, and the default processing
   is to simply ignore them.  This lets you assign these commands to
   your own custom menu items and write your own handlers to carry
   them out.

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   <a name="allocate"></a>
   <b>command.allocate(<i>name</i>):</b>  Allocates a new command from the
   UserFirst...UserLast range for use as a custom command code.  Returns the
   new command code.  If <i>name</i> is given, it will be assigned as the
   name for the new code within the command object: for example, if you
   call command.allocate("MyNewFilter"), command.MyNewFilter will be set
   to the newly assigned command ID.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="name"></a>
   <b>command.name(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns a string with the name for the
   given command ID (an integer value, one of the command.<i>Name</i> properties).
   For the "ranged" commands (FilterFirst to FilterLast, CaptureFirst to CaptureLast, etc),
   a command in the middle of the range will be represented with a name like
   "FilterFirst+3", indicating the numeric offset from the start of the range.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="nameAndIndex"></a>
   <b>command.nameAndIndex(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns an object with properties
   { name: string, index: integer } giving the command's name and, if applicable,
   the index of the command within its range.  For most commands, the name is
   set to the same string that command.name() would return for the
   same ID, and index is undefined.  For the "ranged" commands, name is set to
   the <i>first</i> command of the range (e.g., "FilterFirst"), and index is set
   to the ID's offset from the first command in the range.  This provides an
   easier way to handle ranged commands, since the name is the same for every
   command in the range, and the index within the range is separated out as a
   simple integer value.
