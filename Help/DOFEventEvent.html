<h1>DOFEvent</h1>

<p>
   This Event class represents DOF-related events.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   There's currently only one subtype of this event:
<ul>
   <li><b>dofevent:</b> Fires when the system is about to change the
   value of a DOF named event.  See <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a>
   for a full list of the named events that PinballY generates.
   <p>
      This event is fired at each <i>change</i> to a DOF named event, so you'll
      get one notification when PinballY turns the event ON, and another when
      PinballY turns the event OFF.  Most of the DOF events that PinballY
      generates are momentary "pulsed" events, meaning that PinballY turns
      the event ON briefly and then turns it right back OFF.  For example,
      the events representing key presses, menu selections, and other discrete
      UI actions are all "pulsed".  For such events, you'll see two <b>dofevent</b>
      notifications in quick succession, one for the change to ON status, and
      one for the change to OFF status.  The DOF named events that represent
      the current UI state (PBYWheel, PBYMenu, etc) are left ON as long as the
      state is in effect, as are the named events that represent the current
      game ROM selection in the wheel UI.
   </p>
   <p>
      This event is cancelable.  If you call preventDefault() on the event object
      passed to the handler, PinballY won't update the DOF named event
      after all.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>
   DOF-related events are only fired if DOF is installed in your system and
   PinballY is connected to it.  PinballY doesn't bother firing the events if
   DOF isn't being used.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the additional
   properties listed below.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>name:</b> For <b>dofevent</b> events, a string giving the name
   of the DOF event being turned on or off.  See <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a>
   for a list of the DOF event names that PinballY uses.

   <li><b>value:</b>  For <b>dofevent</b> events, a number from 0 to 255 giving
   the updated value of the named event.  PinballY uses 0 for "OFF" and 1 for "ON"
   for most events.

</ul>
