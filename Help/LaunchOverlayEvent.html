<h1>LaunchEvent</h1>

<p>
   This class represents events that occur during the game launch
   process related to updating the "Launch Overlay", which is a graphics
   layer in the UI where the system displays status messages about
   the progress of the launch.  You can use these events to customize
   the appearance of the overlay.
</p>
<p>
   This class includes the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>launchoverlayshow:</b> Fired when the system initially shows
   the launch overlay.  By default, the system fills the playfield screen
   with a dark background.  You can intercept this event to display your
   own alternative graphics, using the <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay</a>
   object, which lets you access the overlay to draw custom graphics
   or load your own videos or images.
   See the section on the launchOverlay object for details.

   <li><b>launchoverlaymessage:</b> Fired each time the system updates the
   message in the launch overlay.  The system also displays the "wheel icon"
   for the game as part of the text layer.  If you wish to do your own
   custom drawing, you can cancel the event to prevent the system from
   showing its standard message graphics.
   If you let the event proceed, the system draws its default message
   update as usual, but you can modify the text message it displays
   and control whether or not the game's wheel icon is drawn by
   changing properties in the event object.  See the event properties
   below for more details.

   <li><b>launchoverlayhide:</b>  Fired when the system hides the launch
   overlay, when a launched game terminates and PinballY returns to its
   normal UI.  This event can't be canceled as it's fired after the fact.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>

<h2>Event sequence</h2>

<p>
   For each game launch, these events are fired in the following order:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>launchoverlayshow</b> is fired once
   <li><b>launchoverlaymessage</b> is fired several times, corresponding to the
   progress of the launch process; the exact sequence depends upon whether or
   not the launch is successful, whether it's a normal launch for interactive
   play or a launch for media capture, etc
   <li><b>launchoverlayhide</b> is fired once
</ul>


<h2>Drawing layers</h2>

<p>
   The point of these events is to let you take control over the
   visual presentation of the launch process, so it's helpful to understand
   the way the graphics are constructed.  There are actually two drawing
   layers making up the "launch overlay":
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A front layer, where the system displays text messages indicating
   the status of the launch, and the game's wheel icon.  This is all drawn
   with a transparent background fill, so that the back layer shows through.
   You can access this layer via the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay.fg</a>
   object.

   <li>A back layer, for background graphics.  The system simply displays
   a dark background fill here.  You can access this layer via the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg</a>
   object.
</ul>

<p>
   The two layers are separated so that you can display a fixed graphic or
   video background during the entire launch process, with text messages
   superimposed in the foreground layer as the launch process proceeds.
   Since the text messages are in a separate layer, they can be updated at
   each step without having to redraw the background graphics or reload
   the video.
</p>
<p>
   Both of these layers are drawn in front of all of the other layers (the
   wheel icons and the playfield background image or video), which also
   remain on the screen during the launch process.  The system's
   default drawing makes the background layer opaque, hiding the other
   layers.  You can draw a transparent or partially transparent background
   if you want to let the regular playfield background continue to appear
   on screen during the launch.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   Launch events include all of the standard event properties and methods (see the
   <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>game:</b>  A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object representing
   the game being launched.

   <li><b>hideWheelImage:</b>  Applies for the <b>launchoverlaymessage</b> event only.
   If you set this to <b>true</b> before returning from the event listener, the
   system will omit the "wheel icon" that it would normally display as part of
   the status text overlay.

   <li><b>id:</b>  For the <b>launchoverlaymessage</b> event only, this is a
   string abstractly identifying the status that the system is about to display
   in the text message update.  This carries roughly the same information as the
   <b>message</b> property, but the ID is more useful programmatically,
   because it's independent of any language translation and won't be affected
   by any tweaks to the wording of the messages in the UI.  The possible
   ID values are:
   <ul>
      <li><b>"init":</b>  The launch process has just started, and the overlay
      is being newly displayed, with a blank message initially

      <li><b>"launching":</b>  The system is about to launch the game (which
      includes running the "Run Before" step for the game system, as defined
      in the system options)

      <li><b>"capturing":</b>  The game has started running for a media capture
      operation

      <li><b>"running":</b>  The game has started running for normal interactive play

      <li><b>"terminating":</b>  The user has pressed the Exit Game button, so
      the system is about to try terminating the game process

      <li><b>"gameover":</b>  The game program has just ended; the system might
      still be processing the "Run After" step

      <li><b>"after":</b> The game has exited and the system has completed
      the "Run After" step, with only the "Run After Post" step remaining;
      the system normally displays a blank message at this point
   </ul>
   <p>
      Note that changing the ID value in the event object won't have any effect
      on the default display.  If you want to change the displayed message text, change
      the <b>message</b> property instead.
   </p>

   <li><b>message:</b>  For the <b>launchoverlaymessage</b> event only, this is
   a string containing the text of the status update message the system will display.
   This can be <b>null</b> if the system was going to display a blank message.
   You can change this to a different string if you wish to use the standard
   system drawing but replace the message with custom text.

</ul>
