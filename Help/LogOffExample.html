<h1>Log Off (or Sleep) at Shutdown</h1>

<p>
   One of the standard commands in PinballY is "Power Off" (you can
   find this command on the Exit menu), which sends a request to Windows
   to shut down the system and turn off power.  This makes it possible
   to go through a complete session (power on, play some games, power off)
   without having to interact with the Windows desktop at any point, which
   is nice for pin cab users, since it helps maintain the illusion that the
   pin cab is an arcade machine instead of a Windows PC.
</p>
<p>
   But Windows being Windows, everyone has a unique system configuration
   with unique operating requirements, and this can sometimes affect the
   process you have to use to shut down your system.  Indeed, someone
   raised this very point on the forums, reporting that his system is set
   up in such a way that he has to explicitly log off before shutting down.
   That makes the "Power Off" command problematic for him.
</p>
<p>
   Using Javascript, we can change the way the "Power Off" command works
   to make it friendlier to this special situation.  In particular, we can
   change it so that the "Power Off" command doesn't actually execute the
   shutdown, but simply logs off the current user.  That will leave it
   to the user to press the power button to complete the shutdown after
   the logoff succeeds.
</p>
<p>
   Another variation that some people prefer is to put the machine
   into "Sleep" mode rather than doing a full shutdown.  Sleep mode is
   a low-power mode that keeps all running programs in memory, which
   makes it much faster to restart the system next time you want to use
   it.  I pretty much always use sleep mode for my main desktop system
   instead of powering completely off, so I can easily imagine why
   you'd want to do the same thing with your pin cab.  We'll
   cover how to change the normal full power off to sleep mode later
   in this section.
</p>
   

<h2>Logging off</h2>
<p>
   If you've read through any of the other examples, you've seen the
   basic approach for changing the way any command works: we write
   a listener for the <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b> event</a>,
   check the ID in the event object to see if it's the
   <a href="Commands.html#commandIDs">Command ID</a> we want to
   override, and if so, carry out our special function.  We can then
   call the <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>
   method of the event object to cancel the normal system processing.
</p>
<p>
   We should mention a couple of special features of our custom "log off"
   command before we get into the coding.
</p>
<p>
   The first is that the standard Power Off command has a two-step
   process in the UI.  The nominal "Power Off" command
   (<a href="Commands.html#PowerOff">command.PowerOff</a>) doesn't
   actually carry out the operation: its only function is to bring
   up a second menu to confirm that the user really wants to shut
   down.  I like the two-step process because I really hate it when
   I accidentally trigger this command - it takes so long to get the
   system back up and running if you do.  So the <i>real</i> shutdown
   action doesn't happen on the initial PowerOff command, but on
   the confirming command from the second menu,
   <a href="Commands.html#PowerOffConfirm">command.PowerOffConfirm</a>.
   That's the command we actually need to override in our event handler.
</p>
<p>
   The second special feature of this customization is that we'll
   need to talk directly to Windows to carry out the logoff command.
   PinballY doesn't have its own built-in version of this command
   that we can call, so we have to negotiate this directly through
   the Windows APIs.  Fortunately, PinballY's Javascript has a
   provision for this, which you can read all about in
   <a href="DllImport.html">Calling Native DLLs</a>.  Even
   more fortunately, the Windows API for logging off is very
   simple, just a single function call.
</p>
<p>
   One extra step that we should perform is to save any changes to
   the settings before initiating the Windows log-off.  When we call
   the Windows log-off API, Windows immediately starts shutting down
   the current user session, which requires terminating all of the
   programs running under that session.  Windows is supposed to give
   running programs a chance to shut down cleanly, but in practice
   this doesn't always happen; Windows sometimes just kills all of
   the running programs without any warning.  In PinballY's case,
   this can be problematic, because it can interrupt PinballY
   in the middle of writing out any unsaved changes to the settings
   file.  That can leave the settings file only partially written
   to disk, which is obviously bad.  To avoid this risk, we can
   explicitly save settings updates before we even start the
   log-off procedure.  That'll write everything safely to disk,
   and then mark the in-memory copy as in sync with the disk copy,
   so that PinballY won't try to write it again at program exit.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the full code to override the Power Off command and make
   it perform a Log Off command instead.
</p>

<div class="code">
// To log off, we just need to call ExitWindowsEx(0, 0) in the Windows API.
// Bind the DLL function so that we can call it from Javascript when the
// time arrives.
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", `
    BOOL WINAPI ExitWindowsEx(UINT uFlags, DWORD dwReason);
`);

// Take over the Power Off Confirm command
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.PowerOffConfirm) {
        // save any settings changes
        if (optionSettings.isDirty())
            optionSettings.save();

        // log off Windows
        const EWX_LOGOFF = 0;
        const SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_PLANNED = 0x80000000;
        User32.ExitWindowsEx(EWX_LOGOFF, SHTDN_REASON_FLAG_PLANNED);

        // quit out of PinballY
        mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit);

        // skip the normal Power Off command processing
        ev.preventDefault();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that we only took over the execution of the command, without
   changing the way the command appears on menus in the UI.  If you
   wanted to fix up the menu labels to match the new
   function, that's fairly straightforward.  We just have to listen
   for the <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menuopen</b> event</a> and
   make some edits:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Change the label of the command.PowerOff command item, if any, to "Log Off"

   <li>Change the label of the command.PowerOffConfirm item, if any,j to "Confirm Log Off"
</ul>


<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    ev.items.forEach(ele => {
        if (ele.cmd == command.PowerOff) {
            ele.title = "Log Off";
            ev.menuUpdated = true;
        }
        else if (ele.cmd == command.PowerOffConfirm) {
            ele.title = "Confirm Log Off";
            ev.menuUpdated = true;
        }
    });
});
</div>


<h2>Sleep mode</h2>

<p>
   If you want to change the normal full power-off command to a Sleep
   command instead, to put the system in its low-power standby mode,
   the procedure is similar.  We still have to intercept the normal
   power-off command, but this time we'll replace it with a different
   Windows API call to put the system into standby mode.
</p>
<p>
   The standby mode API itself is quite simple, but there's a snag,
   which is that it requires the calling program to enable a special
   "privilege" mode before the API can be used.  The sequence of
   calls to enable the privilege is rather verbose, but it's also
   pretty rote, so I'll just give you the code below without going
   into a lot of explanation.  If you're interested in the internals,
   the code has some comments explaining the step-by-step actions.
</p>
<div class="code">
