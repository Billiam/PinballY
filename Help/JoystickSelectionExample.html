<h1>Joystick Selection Menu</h1>

<p>
   PinballY version 1.1 provides Javascript with lots of access to
   the joystick devices.  Before you can use a joystick in your
   code, though, you need a way to decide which joystick to use,
   since there might be more than one attached to the system.
</p>
<p>
   One way to select a joystick in your scripts is to hard-code
   the selection based on some known attribute of the device,
   such as its product name string or the USB Vendor ID/Product ID
   numbers.  These are all properties that each joystick sends
   to Windows when you plug it in, and which you can get form
   the PinballY Javascript interfaces.  PinballY lets you get
   a list of all attached joysticks, so if there's a particular
   joystick that you always want to use, you can just scan the
   device list to find the one with the name or USB IDs that
   match your desired device.  For example, here's how you can
   use <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>
   and the <a href="JoystickInfo.html">JoystickInfo</a> objects
   it returns to find a Pinscape Controller unit within your system:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let pinscape;
for (let j of mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()) {
    if (/pinscape/i.test(j.productName)) {
        pinscape = j;
        break;
    }
}
</div>

<p>
   That gets a list of all joysticks, and then scans each entry
   for a device whose <b>productName</b> property matches the
   regular expression <tt>/pinscape/i</tt> - in other words,
   the product name has to contain "pinscape" as a substring,
   ignoring upper/lower case differences.  You can easily
   change this to look for any other type of joystick, by changing
   the regular expression <tt>/pinscape/i</tt> to match
   a distinctive substring in your chosen device's product
   name.  Just be sure to pick something that's unique
   enough to your device that it won't accidentally
   match a portion of the name string from some other
   device.
</p>
<p>
   If you're not sure what the product name string for
   your joystick looks like, there's an easy way to find
   out.  Fire up the Windows "Set Up USB Game Controllers"
   control panel, by pressing Windows+R and typing in
   <b>joy.cpl</b>.  The list you see in that control panel
   is simply a list of the product name strings from your
   attached joysticks.
</p>

<h2>Making it more dynamic: let the user choose</h2>
<p>
   Hard-coding the joystick search like this is easy, but
   it's also brittle.  If you ever replace your joystick with
   a different type, for example, the script will stop working
   until you remember that you have to edit the script to
   update the hard-coded product name pattern to match your
   new device.  Or, if you want to share the script with
   someone else, you'll have to explain to them how to
   edit the product name.
</p>
<p>
   A better way is to provide a way for the user to choose
   through the user interface, and then store the selection
   in the option settings file.
</p>

<h3>Storing the selection in the options file</h3>
<p>
   Before we start thinking about the user interface, we
   need to consider how we're going to save the setting
   across sessions.  Since this amounts to a program setting,
   the right place to store it is within the PinballY
   settings file, using the <a href="OptionSettingsObject.html">optionSettings</a>
   object.  That object provides methods to get and set
   custom program variables, so we'll create a new variable
   representing the current joystick selection.
</p>
<p>
   What do we store in the new variable?  PinballY
   mostly identifies joysticks within a program session
   by their "logical unit numbers" - that's the way that
   they're identified in joystick events, for example.
   But the logical unit number is ephemeral, lasting
   only for the duration of the current program session.
   For long-term storage across program sessions, we
   need something more permanent.  Fortunately, Windows
   provides us with an ID that's purpose-built for
   referencing joysticks in program settings, called the
   Instance GUID(for Globally Unique ID).  We can get
   the GUID as a string from a JoystickInfo object.  So
   once we've identified a joystick, we can get its
   GUID, and store that in the configuration variable.
</p>
<p>
   When reading back the settings, we can use the stored
   GUID to look up the JoystickInfo object.  mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()
   accepts GUID strings to identify the joystick when
   fetching its JoystickInfo.
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let configVar = "Custom.Joystick.Device";

// save a JoystickInfo object's GUID
let js = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(0);
optionSettings.set(configVar, j.guid);

// get the JoystickInfo for a saved GUID
js = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(optionSettings.get(configVar));
</div>

<h3>Displaying a selection menu</h2>
<p>
   It's easy to create a new on-screen menu in PinballY, so
   let's use a menu to display the available joysticks and
   let the user pick which one to use.  To access the joystick
   selection menu, we'll add a new command to one of the existing
   menus, bringing up our new menu when the user selects that
   command.  (For full details on creating custom menus,
   see <a href="Menus.html">Menus</a>.)
</p>
<p>
   The Operator Menu seems to me like the right place
   for this, so let's add a new item to the Operator Menu,
   right after the "PinballY Options" command:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
// Add the joystick selection command to the Operator Menu
let joystickSetupCommand = command.allocate("JoystickSetup");
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "operator") {
        ev.addMenuItem(
            { after: command.Options },
            { title: "Joystick Setup", cmd: joystickSetupCommand });
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   Now we have to write a "command" event for our new custom command,
   which displays the menu.  This menu is a little different from most
   in that it's going to be a list of joysticks, not a list of pre-determined
   commands.  But a menu really is just a list of commands, so what we have
   to do is associate a custom command with each joystick.  We'll show the
   product name of the joystick as its menu title, but we'll have to create
   a custom command behind the scenes to represent the action to take when
   the use selects that menu item.
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
// Handle our Joystick Setup custom command
let joystickNoneCommand = command.allocate("JoystickNone");
let joystickSelectCommands = [];
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == joystickSetupCommand) {
        // Get the current selection from the options
        let cur = optionSettings.get(configVar);
    
        // Set up the "dialog header" portion of the menu, and
        // add "None" as the first selection.  If 
        let menu = [
            {title: "Select a joystick to use", cmd: -1},
            { cmd: -1 },
            { title: "None - Disabled", cmd: joystickNoneCommand, radio: !cur },
        ];

        // Now enumerate all of the joysticks, adding a menu item for each
        let n = 0;
        for (let j of mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()) {
            // if necessary, allocate a new custom command ID for this index
            if (n >= joystickSelectCommands.length)
                joystickSelectCommands.push(command.allocate("JoystickSelect" + n));

            // add the menu command, using the custom command ID at this index
            menu.push({
                title: j.productName,
                cmd: joystickSelectCommands[n++],
                radio: j.guid == cur });
        }

        // Display the menu
        mainWindow.showMenu("joystick setup", menu, { dialogStyle: true });
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   That's a little complicated, so let's step through it.  First, we
   create a custom command for "JoystickNone", meaning no joystick
   is currently selected.  We then set up our "command" event listener,
   and check to see if we're firing our custom Joystick Setup command.
   If so, we start building the menu, as a Javascript array of menu
   descriptor objects.
</p>
<p>
   The first thing that goes in the menu is the "dialog header" part.
   This is a fixed string that's displayed at the top of the menu, to
   explain to the user what the menu is about.  If you're going to
   incorporate this code into something larger, like our
   <a href="JoystickGameSwitcherExample.html">Joystick Game Switcher</a> example,
   you could expand the title to say more about what the joystick
   will be used for - "Select a joystick for wheel navigation", say.
</p>
<p>
   After the explainer text at the top, we add a separator bar (no
   title, command ID -1), and then a menu item for "None - Disabled",
   to select no joystick at all.  This lets the user disable the
   feature if desired.
</p>
<p>
   Now we get to the list of joysticks.  We call mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()
   to get an array of JoystickInfo objects for all of the joysticks in
   the system, and then we loop through the array.  For each joystick,
   we first make sure we have a custom command ID for it, since we always
   need a command ID for an active menu item, then we add the menu item
   for the joystick to the menu array.  We use the Product Name string
   from the joystick as the menu title, and we use the custom command
   at the current index for the command ID.
</p>
<p>
   One more little detail: you'll notice that each menu item has a
   <b>radio</b> property.  This tells the menu system to display
   a "radio button" dot next to an item if the property is true.
   In each case, we set the property to true if the current joystick's
   GUID matches the GUID stored in the option settings for the currently
   selected joystick.  That will make the menu come up each time with
   a radio button dot displayed next to the current selection.
</p>
<p>
   That'll display the joystick selection menu, but we still have to
   handle the custom commands that appear in the menu.  The menu
   has one custom command for "None - Disabled", and then one more
   custom command for each joystick.  In each case, we just have to
   update the GUID stored in the options settings variable for the
   current joystick selection:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == joystickNoneCommand) {
        // "None - Disabled" - store an empty GUID in the settings
        optionSettings.set(configVar, undefined);
        onUpdateJoystickSelection();
    }
    else if ((idx = joystickSelectCommands.indexOf(ev.id)) >= 0) {
        // It's one of the joystick selection commands
        let newJoystick = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(idx);
        if (newJoystick) {
            optionSettings.set(configVar, newJoystick.guid);
            onUpdateJoystickSelection();
        }
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   Note how we relate the command ID back to the joystick unit.
   When we set up the menu, we scanned through the joystick array
   that we got from mainWindow.getJoystickInfo().  That array is
   always provided in order of logical unit number, so the index
   in the array is the same as the logical unit number.  We built
   our own array of custom command IDs for the joysticks in the
   same order.  We find the array index of the command ID in
   our command array, and, knowing that this is the same as the
   array index in the original JoystickInfo array, and that
   <i>that</i> index is the same as the logical unit number,
   we can ask getJoystickInfo() for the joystick corresponding
   to the command.  With the JoystickInfo object in hand, we
   can get the GUID from its <b>guid</b> property.
</p>
<p>
   We created one new loose end in the command handler above:
   we called a new function, onUpdateJoystickSelection().  That's
   not a system thing - that's something we're going to write
   ourselves.  The purpose is to update our internal idea of
   the current joystick selection whenever the selection changes.
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
let currentJoystick;
function onUpdateJoystickSelection()
{
    // disable axis change events on the old joystick
    if (currentJoystick)
       currentJoystick.enableAxisEvents({ enable: false });

    // read the GUID from the options, and get the JoystickInfo
    // object for the GUID
    let guid = optionSettings.get(configVar));
    currentJoystick = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(guid);

    // if we found the joystick, do any initial setup
    if (currentJoystick) {
        currentJoystick.enableAxisEvents({ axis: ["X", "Y"] });
        currentJoystick.setAxisRange("X", -1, 1);
        currentJoystick.setAxisRange("Y", -1, 1);
    }
}
</div>
<p>
   If you need to do anything special in your own code when
   the joystick selection changes, you can add that to the
   function.
</p>
<p>
   We can now use this same function for two more important
   purposes: to restore the saved joystick selection when PinballY
   first starts up, and to update it whenever the configuration
   file is reloaded.
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
// when the script first runs, restore the saved settings
onUpdateJoystickSelection();

// update the joystick selection whenever the settings file is reloaded
optionSettings.on("settingsreload", ev => onUpdateJoystickSelection());
</div>

<p>
   Now that we have the currently selected joystick always
   stored in the variable <b>currentJoystick</b>, we can
   simply reference this variable in places that care about
   the current selection, such as joystick event handlers:
</p>

<div class="code javascript">
mainWindow.on("joystickaxischange", ev => {
    if (currentJoystick &amp;&amp; ev.unit == currentJoystick.unit) {
        // it's the currently selected unit - handle the event
    }
});
</div>

</body>
</html>
