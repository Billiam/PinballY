<h1>Flash Player (.swf files)</h1>

<p>
   <img src="SampleInstructionCard.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1em 2em;">
   For historical reasons, many of the scanned pinball apron instruction
   cards that you can find for download on the Web are in SWF
   (Shockwave Flash) format.  PinballY can display these instruction
   card files, but only if you install the Adobe Flash Player ActiveX
   control.
</p>

<h2>What to install</h2>
<p>
   PinballY specifically requires the <b>ActiveX</b> version of the
   Flash Player.  This is also known as the Flash plug-in for
   Internet Explorer.  There are separate Flash plug-ins for other
   browsers as well, but PinballY can't use those.  You'll need
   to install the ActiveX version even if
   you already have Flash working in Chrome or Firefox.
</p>
<p>
   Getting the ActiveX version is a bit trickier than you'd think.
   Adobe's Flash download page tries to make things "easy" by automatically
   selecting a plug-in to match the browser you use to access the
   download page.  But that actually makes things harder in this case,
   when you need a specific version.  Here's how to override the automatic
   selection and get the version you actually need for PinballY:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Go to the <a target="_blank" href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Adobe Flash download page</a>

   <li>Click "Need Flash Player for a different computer?"

   <li>Select "Windows 7/Vista/XP" for the operating system (regardless of what you're using)

   <li>Select "FP 32 for Internet Explorer - ActiveX" for the version

   <li>Un-check the various MacAfee bloatware add-on boxes (unless you like bloatware!)

   <li>Click Download Now

   <li>Run the downloaded installer EXE file and follow the on-screen prompts to install
</ul>

<h2>But I already installed Flash for my Web browser!</h2>

<p>
   The Flash plug-in comes in several versions for different browsers.
   Chrome uses one version, Firefox uses another version, and Internet
   Explorer uses yet another.  Unfortunately, the different plug-ins
   have incompatible interfaces, so you have to separately install each
   one that you need.  What's more, some browsers have Flash support
   built in, so they don't need plug-ins at all.
</p>
<p>In the case of PinballY, the Flash ActiveX control (also known as
   the Internet Explorer plug-in) is the one that's needed.  It doesn't
   matter if you have the Chrome version and/or Firefox version,
   since PinballY can't access those.
</p>
<p>
   Follow the step-by-step procedure above under "What to install" to
   get the ActiveX version.
<p>
   It's perfectly fine to keep all of the different plug-ins installed at the
   same time.  Adding the ActiveX version won't affect any of the other
   versions you might already have installed.
</p>


<h2>Why SWF?</h2>
<p>
   Why in the world are we talking about SWF files when even Adobe
   considers them obsolete?  Blame history.   The first front end for
   virtual pin cabs was a program called HyperPin.  It was the only
   option in the early days, so most pin cab builders used it, and
   when they shared media files online, they naturally used the
   file formats that HyperPin could work with.  HyperPin happened
   to use .swf format for instruction card images.  HyperPin isn't
   as widely used any more, but all of those media files that people
   uploaded (including all of those .swf instruction cards) are still
   out there.  At some point maybe someone will tackle the big job of
   converting them all to modern image file formats and uploading new
   versions, but in the meantime, the path of least resistance is
   to install Flash Player so that you can use the existing .swf
   files without any extra conversion steps.  (I've looked for
   options that would let PinballY perform the conversion automatically,
   but all of those also require installing Flash Player!  And once
   you do that, you can view the .swf files directly, so it makes
   no sense to convert them at that point.  If a free converter
   program or library comes along that works independently of
   Flash Player, I'll be happy to incorporate that so we can get
   rid of the Flash requirement.)
