<h1>SWF files (Shockwave Flash)</h1>

<p>
   <img src="SampleInstructionCard.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1em 2em;">
   For historical reasons, many of the scanned pinball apron instruction
   cards that you can find for download on the Web are in SWF
   (Shockwave Flash) format.
</p>
<p>
   As of PinballY version 1.1 Beta 5,
   PinballY can display simple SWF files natively, without
   any plug-ins, using its own built-in renderer.  There's no
   need to install Adobe Flash Player or any other third-party software.
</p>

<h2>Flash Player is no longer used</h2>
<p>
   In the past, PinballY relied upon the Adobe Flash Player plug-in
   to display SWF files.  Adobe made Flash Player obsolete as
   of the start of 2021, and pushed out an update that disabled
   existing Flash Player installations, so PinballY can no longer
   use it for SWF file rendering.
</p>
<p>
   In version 1.1 Beta 5, PinballY addressed the end of Flash Player
   by adding its own built-in SWF renderer.  I felt it was important
   for PinballY to continue supporting SWF, since a large number
   of HyperPin Media Packs contain instruction cards prepared in
   the SWF format, and since it's relatively difficult to convert
   existing SWF to other image file formats.  The built-in SWF
   renderer is designed to make that possible without relying on
   any third-party software.
</p>
<p>
   If you installed Flash Player on your system in the past just
   for the sake of PinballY, you can now remove it.  PinballY
   no longer uses it.
</p>


<h2>Why SWF?</h2>
<p>
   Adobe considers SWF to be a dead format, so why does PinballY
   support it?  It's simply because many of the instruction
   cards available for download from the virtual pinball sites
   are in SWF format.  It's convenient in PinballY to be able to
   use those existing SWF files directly, especially since it's
   not straightforward to convert them to other more modern
   formats.
</p>
<p>
   You might wonder how all of these SWF instruction cards
   came to be in the first place.  SWF is known primarily as an
   animation format, whereas the instruction cards are just
   static graphics (and pretty simple graphics at that).
   Why weren't
   they originally created as PNGs or JPEGs?  There's actually a
   good reason: SWF supports vector graphics, whereas
   PNG and JPEG are purely raster (pixel) formats.  Vector formats
   scale to any size without losing any fidelity, so SWF was chosen
   as a sort of future-proofing, on the expectation that people
   would want to display the cards at ever-larger pixel sizes
   as monitor resolution increased.
   Unfortunately, even though it was a great idea to use vector
   graphics, the particular choice of file format almost ended up
   defeating the whole purpose, since SWF files are nearly
   useless now that the whole format is dead.  It hardly matters
   that you can zoom them to any size if you can't display
   them at all.  On the other hand, while Adobe has the power
   to kill Flash Player, they can't erase the SWF format from existence.
   They probably wish they had a time machine so they could, but
   for now, that's beyond their powers.
   The SWF format is documented well enough that I was able to
   create a mini-renderer that can at least handle the
   limited subset of SWF needed to display most of the extant
   instruction cards.  So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
   to use SWF after all.  (And I'm actually happy that
   PinballY is rid of Flash Player, because I never much
   liked that approach for displaying these files.  The
   integrated mini-renderer is lighter on resources, fits
   into the rest of the program more cleanly, and eliminates
   an annoying installation dependency.  I should have built
   one when first writing PinballY, but Flash Player was too expedient
   an option at the time.)
</p>
<p>
   Just to be clear, PinballY doesn't require you to use SWF instruction
   cards!  It's perfectly happy to use an ordinary image format
   like PNG and JPEG whenever an instruction card is displayed.
   The only reason we're talking about SWF is that it's still
   the format of choice for a large number of extant HyperPin
   Media Packs, so we wanted to let you use those without doing
   any conversions.
