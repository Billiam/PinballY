<h1>Media Capture Options</h1>

<p>
   PinballY lets you create the background media items for each of
   your tables - images and videos of the playfield, backglass, and so on -
   by launching the table in its player program and capturing screen shots
   (still or video) while it runs.  The Media Capture options dialog lets
   you set up the details for these screen shot operations.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this dialog doesn't actually initiate a capture operation;
   it's just for setting up the options.  To perform a media capture for
   a game:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Close the options dialog and go back to the main game window
   <li>Navigate to the game you want to capture media for
   <li>Bring up the "System" menu by pressing the Service Enter button
   <li>Select the "Game Setup" command
   <li>Select the "Capture Images &amp; Video" command
   <li>Choose the items you want to capture using the menu
   <li>Select the "Begin Capture" command
</ul>
<h2>Option details</h2>
<p>
   <b>Wait for game to start:</b>  This setting lets you specify a
   delay time before the first screen shot is captured, to give the
   game a chance to initialize and enter its "attract mode".  This
   delay time starts after the player program has loaded, so it
   doesn't need to count the time required to start the player;
   it only needs to count the time it takes the player to load
   the table, plus the time the table itself takes to complete
   its own startup.  Most tables have a "self test" that they
   have to complete when first loaded, so you should take this
   time into account.  The "right" value for this delay is
   unpredictable, because it depends on so many different
   factors: your system's performance, the player program's
   load time, and the individual table's ROM program.  If you
   find that the screen capture is kicking in too soon for
   some tables, just increase this delay time setting a bit
   and try again.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Video capture times:</b>  These settings let you set the
   length of the videos captured for the various windows.  When
   PinballY plays back the videos, they'll all be shown in loops,
   so you effectively get "infinite" video coverage no matter how
   long you make the individual videos.  But it's better to make
   the loops long enough to cover at least one whole attract
   mode loop for the game, so that the video isn't too
   repetitive, and so that you don't see jumps back to the
   beginning so often that they're distracting.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Use two-pass video encoding:</b>  Use this option if your
   captured videos look too choppy.  Normally, PinballY tries to
   capture and compress video frames at the same time, in
   a single pass.  This requires a fairly fast machine, though; on
   slower machines, the compressor might have to drop frames (omit
   them from the resulting video) when it can't keep up with the
   live video rate.  Dropped frames are visible as momentary
   freezes when you play back the video, which can make the
   video look choppy or jerky.  If this happens on your machine,
   you can try two-pass encoding instead.  Two-pass encoding
   initially captures the video frames without any compression,
   which can usually be done without any dropped frames even on
   slower machines.  It then goes back and re-encodes the video
   to a compressed format after the full capture has finished.
   This takes longer overall because of the separate second pass,
   but should eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) dropped
   frames in the resulting video.
