<h1>Command Line Options</h1>
<p>
   PinballY has a few command-line options that can be specified 
   when launching the program.  When you launch a Windows program
   by double-clicking its program .EXE file, you're launching it
   without any command-line options.  If you want to add options,
   you have to use one of the other ways of launching a program:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>From the Windows desktop, press Windows+R to open the Run
   dialog, then type in the command line, starting with the program
   name, including its full file path

   <li>Open a CMD prompt and enter the command there

   <li>Create a Windows desktop shortcut to PinballY.EXE,
   and type the command line into the Target box, starting with
   the program name (including its full path).  After creating
   the shortcut, you can double-click the shortcut file to launch
   the program with the options.  This is the easiest way if
   you plan to use the same options on every future launch,
   since it stores them with the shortcut so that you don't
   have to type them again on every launch.
</ul>

<p>
   When constructing a command line (for any of those methods),
   it's always a good idea to put quotes around the program file
   path, so that Windows doesn't get confused by any embedded
   spaces or other special characters:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <tt>"c:\PinballY\PinballY.exe" /Settings:D:/MyFiles</tt>
</div>

<h2>Basic syntax</h2>
<p>
   Options are all listed after the program name, separated
   by spaces.  Unless otherwise specified in the notes about the
   individual options, the order of the options doesn't matter.
   If an option contains any spaces, enclose the entire option
   in double quotes.
</p>

<h2>List of options</h2>

<p>
   <b>/GameStats:<i>directory</i></b><br>
   Specifies the directory to use for the game stats file (GameStats.csv),
   where PinballY stores game metadata that applies to both configured
   and unconfigured games.
   If this isn't specified, GameStats.cvs is located in the PinballY
   program folder.  You can use this to specify an alternative location.
   This can be useful, for example, if you want to store your databases
   on a network drive so that they can be shared with other machines
   on your LAN.
</p>

<p>
   <b>/jsdebug</b><br> Enables the Javascript debugging service,
   so that you can use a separate Javascript debugger program,
   such as the Chrome Dev Tools, to connect to PinballY's
   Javascript engine to inspect and debug your scripts
   interactively.  See <a href="JsDebug.html">Javascript Debugging</a>
   for details on this option.
</p>

<p>
   <b>/Settings:<i>directory</i></b><br>
   Specifies the directory to use for the settings file (Settings.txt).
   If this isn't specified, the settings file is located in the PinballY
   program folder.  You can use this to specify an alternative location.
   This can be useful, for example, if you want to store your settings
   on a network drive so that they can be shared with other machines
   on your LAN.
