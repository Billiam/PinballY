<h1>Button Options</h1>

<p>
   This lets you select the keyboard keys or joystick buttons
   assigned to the PinballY command functions.
</p>
<p>
   The list shows all of the available command functions.  If
   the command already has a keyboard key or joystick button
   assigned, it'll be listed in the "Key" column.
</p>
<p>
   To change the key or button assigned to a command, click the
   mouse on the current key name.  (If there's no key assigned
   to the command yet, just click on the blank area in the
   "Key" column for the command.)  Now just press the key or
   joystick button that you want to assign to the command.
</p>
<p>
   You can assign almost any key on the keyboard to each command,
   including the "modifier" keys (the Shift keys, Alt, and Ctrl).
   The left and right Shift, Alt, and Ctrl keys count as separate
   keys, so you can assign (say) the Left Shift and Right
   Shift keys to separate commands.
</p>

<h3>Why can't I assign Ctrl+X, Alt+X, etc?</h3>
<p>
   Because the Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Windows keys can
   all be assigned as command keys in their own right.  As soon as
   you press a key - even a modifier key like Shift or Ctrl - it
   immediately carries out its assigned command.  That prevents
   using the modifier keys to form combinations with other keys.
</p>
<p>
   This is different from Windows productivity apps, where
   it's more common to use combinations like Ctrl+X and Alt+X
   for command keys.   But it's common in Windows games; it's
   the way that all of the pinball simulators (Visual Pinball,
   Future Pinball, etc) treat the keyboard during play.  That's
   one reason that we use this approach: it makes for a more
   consistent experience switching back and forth between
   PinballY and game players.  It also works better for
   pin cabs, which is PinballY's primary audience, since
   pin cab users want to be able to operate everything with
   the cabinet buttons; they don't want to have to get out a
   keyboard to access Ctrl/Shift/Alt combinations.
</p>

<h2>Multiple keys per command</h2>

<p>
   You can assign more than one key or button to the same
   command.  This simply lets you access the command from
   any of the assigned buttons.  If you've already assigned
   one key to a command, you can assign a second one as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Move the mouse over the "Key" column for the command

   <li>Click the "+" button that appears at the right edge

   <li>A new row will appear for the same command, with no key
   assigned yet

   <li>Click in the blank "Key" area of the new row

   <li>Press the new keyboard key or joystick button that you want to assign
</ul>

<p>
   You can repeat this process to assign any number of keys
   to the same command.
</p>

<p>
   To delete one of the keys assigned to a
   command, move the mouse over the key name you want to
   delete, and click the "X" button that appears at the
   right side.
</p>

<h2>Multiple commands per key</h2>

<p>
   You can assign the same keyboard key or joystick button to more than
   one command.  If you do, pressing the key/button will activate each of
   the commands assigned to it.
</p>
<p>
   You wouldn't want to do this for most commands, but it's useful in
   some limited cases.  In particular, the "Exit" and "Exit Game" commands
   are usually mapped to the same key (usually the Escape key).  In this
   case, using the same key for both commands won't create any confusion,
   because "Exit" and "Exit Game" operate in different contexts.
</p>
<p>
   The program will warn you any time you try to assign a new command
   to a key that already has a command assigned.  The warning lets you know
   that the key is already in use, and lets you select whether you'd like
   to add the new command (keeping the existing command assignment(s))
   or simply replace the existing command(s) with the new one.
</p>
   

<h2>Joystick assignments</h2>

<p>
   Joystick buttons can be assigned "generically", or for a specific joystick device.
</p>
<p>
   The default is to assign joystick buttons generically.  This means that PinballY
   doesn't think of the button as belonging to a specific joystick; only the 
   button number is important.  If a command is assigned generically to
   "Joystick button 4", pressing the 4th button on any attached joystick
   activates the command.
</p>
<p>
   If you check the box at the bottom of the dialog that says "Remember device
   for each joystick button", then the program will tie buttons to individual
   joystick devices.  Button assignments you make after checking the box will
   show the joystick device name in addition to the button number.  For these
   assignments, the command will only be triggered when you press the given
   button on the same joystick.  Pressing the same numbered button on another
   joystick device won't have any effect.  That means that you can assign
   a different command to the same numbered button on a separate joystick, if
   you have two or more joysticks attached to your system.
</p>
<p>
   If you only have one joystick, or if you only use the buttons on one
   joystick, you should use the "generic" mode.  The generic mode is
   better in this case because it's more flexible in terms of changes
   to your system.  If you switch to a different joystick
   device in the future, for example, generic button assignments will continue
   to be recognized.  The "Remember" mode is only necessary if you
   have two or more joystick devices attached to your system at the
   same time, and you want to assign commands to the buttons
   on each joystick independently.
</p>
<p>
   Any change to the "Remember" setting only applies to
   <b>new</b> command assignments made after you change the setting.
   Any existing assignments will remain as they were.  That lets you use
   a mix of generic and device-specific button assignments, if you wish.
   If you want to change an existing button assignment from generic to
   device-specific or vice versa, simply re-do that button assignment
   with the new checkbox setting in effect.

<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: 0px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Select/Enter:</b>  This is the main "do it" command throughout the
   user interface.  When a menu is visible, pressing Select activates
   the current menu command.  When a popup window is showing, Select
   usually closes it.  When nothing else is going on, Select brings
   up the main game menu.  This command is normally assigned to the
   Start button on a pin cab, which is typically mapped to the "1"
   key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -24px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Cancel/Escape:</b>  This is the main "cancel" or "return" command
   throughout the user interface.  When a menu is visible, pressing
   Exit dismisses the menu (without activating any commands).
   When a popup window is showing, Exit closes it.  When nothing
   else is going on, Exit brings up the "Exit" menu, which shows
   options for exiting out of PinballY and a few other system
   functions.  This command is normally assigned to the
   Exit button on a pin cab, which is typically mapped to the Escape
   key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -48px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Exit Game:</b>  When there's a game running, pressing
   this button terminates the game and returns to the PinballY
   game list.  On pin cabs, this is usually assigned to the
   "Exit" button, which is usually mapped to the Escape key
   on the keyboard.  This is usually the same key or button
   mapped for the Cancel/Escape command above, but the two
   functions are separated into different commands in
   case you want to map them as different buttons for
   some reason.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -72px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Next:</b>  Navigates to the next game, menu item, popup
   page, etc.  This is normally assigned to the Right Flipper
   button on a pin cab, which is usually mapped to the Right Shift
   key.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -96px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Previous:</b>  Navigates to the previous game, menu item,
   popup page, etc.  This is normally assigned to the Left
   Flipper button on a pin cab, which is usually the Left Shift key.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -120px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Next Page:</b>  Navigates to the next letter group in the
   game list, the next page of a menu, etc.  This is normally
   assigned to the Right Magna Save button on a pin cab, which
   is usually the Right Ctrl key.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -144px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Previous Page:</b>  Navigates to the previous letter group
   in the game list, the previous page of a menu, etc.  This is
   normally assigned to the Left Magna Save button on a pin cab,
   which is usually the Left Ctrl key.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -168px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Launch:</b>  This command directly launches the
   currently selected game without bringing up the menu.
   This is just a convenience to bypass the extra step
   of selecting "Play" from the menu.  When a menu is
   showing, this acts the same as the Select button.
   The usual mapping for this command is the "Launch
   Ball" button, if your pin cab has one; this is
   usually mapped to the Enter key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -192px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Information:</b>  Shows information on the current game.
   There's no standard pin cab button for this, but some
   pin cab builders include a few extra front-panel buttons
   for special functions like this; if you have such
   a button, you can map it to this function.  This button
   is completely optional, though, since you can access
   the same function with a couple of button clicks via the
   "Information" command in the main game menu.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -216px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Instructions:</b>  Displays the instruction card for
   the current game in a popup window.  There's no standard
   pin cab button for this, but some pin cab builders include
   a few extra front-panel buttons for special functions like
   this.  This button is completely optional, though, since
   you can access the same function with a couple of button
   clicks via the "Instructions" command in the main
   game menu.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -240px 0px; width: 96px;"></div>
   <b>Coin 1/2/3/4:</b>  If your pin cab has real coin slot
   switches wired to your key encoder, or you just have a "Coin In"
   button, you can assign the button to the Coin 1/2/3/4 functions.
   There are four of these commands because some pin cabs have
   multiple coin chutes with different denominations, in which
   case you'd want to assign a distinct command for each slot.
   The normal pin cab mappings for the coin chutes are the "3", "4",
   "5", and "6" keys, for the left, middle, right, and fourth coin
   chutes respectively.  For US coin doors with two chutes, you'd
   normally map them to "3" and "5", since they count as left and
   right (with the "middle" and "fourth" slots unused).</p>
<p>
   If you map the coin commands, PinballY will keep track of coins
   inserted and will add "credits" to an internal counter, but this
   is purely for the sake of arcade simulation.  It doesn't have
   any practical use, so you can leave the coin buttons
   unmapped if you don't care about this bit of simulation detail.
   See <a href="CoinOptions.html">Coin Options</a>
   for more on coin handling.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -336px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Coin door:</b>  If your pin cab has a coin door switch
   (that detects when the door is open or closed), you can map
   that key here.  PinballY doesn't currently use this for
   anything, but could in the future.  The typical pin cab
   setup uses the "End" key for the coin door switch.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -360px 0px; width: 96px;"></div>
   <b>Service 1/2/3/4:</b>  If your pin cab has a four-button
   service panel inside the coin door, you can assign those
   keys here.  These are normally assigned to the "7", "8",
   "9", and "0" keys on the keyboard.  PinballY uses the
   "Service 4/Enter" button to activate the "System" menu,
   which is useful for setting up new games and editing
   game details.  The other service keys can be used to
   navigate within the service menu, but they're optional,
   since you can navigate this menu equally well with the
   regular Next/Previous/Select/Exit keys instead.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -456px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Frame Counter:</b>  Shows on-screen performance
   statistics, including the CPU load and a frames-per-second
   counter showing the graphics redraw rate.  This can be
   helpful to gauge the effect on PinballY performance when
   adjusting your video card settings or other system
   settings.  There's no standard pin cab key for this,
   but Visual Pinball uses the "F10" key to control its
   similar performance counter display.  You can also
   access this function via the right-click menu in the
   main window.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -480px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Full Screen Toggle:</b>  Toggles the current window
   between normal and Full Screen modes.  There's no
   standard pin cab key for this, but many other Windows
   apps (especially Web browsers) use the "F11" key for
   the same function.  You can also access this function
   with the right-click menu in any window.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -504px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Settings:</b>  Brings up the setting dialog.  There's
   no standard pin cab key for this.  You can also access
   this function from the right-click menu in the main window.
</p>
<p>
   <div class="ButtonImage" style="background-position: -528px 0px;"></div>
   <b>Rotate Monitor:</b>  Rotates the current window's
   contents by 90 degrees clockwise.  You can use this to
   adjust the display rotation of each window to match your
   physical monitor setup.  There's no standard pin cab
   key for this.  You can also access this function from
   the right-click menu in any window.
