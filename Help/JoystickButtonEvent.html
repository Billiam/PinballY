<h1>JoystickButtonEvent</h1>

<p>
   This is the Event subclass that represents joystick button events.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>joystickbuttondown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a joystick
   button.  Also fires each time the button "auto-repeats" while the user
   is holding it down.

   <li><b>joystickbuttonup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a button.
</ul>

<p>
   Joystick button events are always fired on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the application was in the background when
   the event occurred, false if not.  PinballY processes button presses
   that occur while it's in the background so that it can monitor
   "Exit Game" and "Pause Game" commands while a game is running.

   <li><b>button:</b> A number representing which button on the joystick
   was pressed.  Joystick buttons are numbered consecutively from 1 to
   the number of buttons on the unit.

   <li><b>repeat:</b>  true if this is an auto-repeat button event from
   a button being held down, false if not

   <li><b>unit:</b> A number representing which joystick the button
   belongs to.
</ul>
