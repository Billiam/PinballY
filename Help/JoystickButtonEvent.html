<h1>JoystickButtonEvent</h1>

<p>
   This is the Event subclass that represents joystick button events.
   There are four joystick button event subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <a name="joystickbuttondown"></a>
   <li><b>joystickbuttondown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a joystick
   button while PinballY is in the foreground.  Also fires each time the
   button "auto-repeats" while the user is holding it down.

   <a name="joystickbuttonup"></a>
   <li><b>joystickbuttonup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a button
   while the program is in the foreground.

   <a name="joystickbuttonbgdown"></a>
   <li><b>joystickbuttonbgdown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a joystick
   button while PinballY is in the background (that is, while another
   application's window is in front and has keyboard focus).  Also fires
   each time the button "auto-repeats" while the program is in the background.

   <a name="joystickbuttonbgup"></a>
   <li><b>joystickbuttonbgup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a button
   while the program is in the background.
</ul>

<p>
   Joystick button events are always fired on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the application was in the background when
   the event occurred, false if not.  PinballY processes button presses
   that occur while it's in the background so that it can monitor
   "Exit Game" and "Pause Game" commands while a game is running.

   <li><b>button:</b> A number representing which button on the joystick
   was pressed.  Joystick buttons are numbered consecutively from 1 to
   the number of buttons on the unit.

   <li><b>repeat:</b>  true if this is an auto-repeat button event from
   a button being held down, false if not.  (Windows joystick devices
   don't have a concept of "auto-repeat" the way that keyboards do,
   but PinballY provides simulated auto-repeat to make joystick buttons
   more consistent with keyboard behavior, so that pin cab buttons work
   the same way in PinballY whether wired through a keyboard or joystick encoder
   device.  PinballY uses the system keyboard control panel settings to
   simulate auto-repeat events for joysticks with the same timing as
   for keyboard keys.)

   <li><b>unit:</b> The "logical unit number" of the joystick that
   generated the event, representing which joystick the button belongs to.
   If multiple joysticks are attached to the system, this allows the
   program to distinguish which one generated the event.  The logical
   unit number isn't anything Windows knows about; it's just an internal
   ID assigned by PinballY to tell joysticks apart.
</ul>

<h2>Background events</h2>

<p>
   As with <a href="KeyEvent.html">keyboard events</a>, the joystick
   system uses separate event types for button presses that occur
   when the program is in the foreground and background.  The reasons
   to separate the events are the same as for keyboard events; refer
   to the key event section for details.
