<h1>Family Filter</h1>

<p>
  A couple of people have asked for a way to hide the racier
  games in their collections when their kids are using the
  machine.  I'm sure this idea appeals to a few people, but
  it struck me as a good candidate for a Javascript
  customization rather than a built-in feature, since
  there are lots of ways you might want to implement it.
</p>
<p>
  This example shows how to create a "Family Filter" mode,
  which lets you show or hide your adult-themed games using
  a command in the Operator Menu.  The Operator Menu is
  a good place to put a command like this, since you can
  limit access to it in a pin cab by physically locking the
  button behind the coin door.  As long as you keep the
  coin door key safely away from the kids, they won't be
  able to access the menu to switch to adult mode.
</p>

<h2>Category tags</h2>

<p>
   A key PinballY feature that we'll use to implement
   our Family Filter mode is <a href="UsageTips.html#categories">category tags</a>.
   A category tag is a short text string that you can associate with
   each game.  You can tag each game with as many categories as
   you want, so you can use these tags to represent any set of
   miscellaneous attributes.
</p>
<p>
   For this example, we'll use the category tag "Adult" to indicate
   that a game should be excluded from view when in Family Filter
   mode.  Before you can tag any games with this tag, you have to
   add the tag to the list that PinballY knows about.  Category
   tags are up to you to define - there's no pre-set list that
   you're forced to use - so you have to go through this initial
   step to add a new tag to the available list:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Bring up the Operator Menu (press the digit zero "0")
   <li>Select Game Setup
   <li>Select "Select Categories"
   <li>Select Edit Category Names
   <li>Click the New button
   <li>Type the new category name (Adult) and click OK
</ul>

<p>
   Now you can add the Adult category tag to each game that you want
   to hide while in Family Filter mode:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Bring up the Operator Menu (press the digit zero "0")
   <li>Select Game Setup
   <li>Select "Select Categories"
   <li>Checkmark "Adult"
   <li>Select Save
</ul>

<h2>Metafilters</h2>

<p>
   The second main ingredient to implementing our family mode is the
   <a href="MetaFilters.html">metafilter</a>.  A metafilter
   is a Javascript filter that sits on top of the "regular"
   filter (such as the era filters and manufacturer filters)
   to supervise the selection.  Metafilters can override
   the regular filter's decisions about which games to
   include and which to exclude.  This makes it easy to
   implement a Family Filter that excludes all games that
   have been tagged as "adult", regardless of which regular
   filter is currently selected.  That lets users use the
   normal set of filters to slice and dice the game collection
   as they please, while still filtering out all of the
   adult-themed games.
</p>
<p>
   The code for the family mode filter is pretty simple.
   When family filtering is in effect, all we need to do is
   exclude games that include the "Adult" category tag.
   Here's how you create the filter.
</p>
<div class="code">
let familyFilterId;
function enableFamilyFilter()
{
    // create the filter
    familyFilterId = gameList.createMetaFilter({
        priority: 1000,
        select: function(game, include) {
            return game.categories.indexOf("Adult") < 0;
        }
    });
}
</div>

<p>
   The <b>select</b> function is the place where we write the
   selection rule for the metafilter.  In this case, we only
   want to include games that <b>don't</b> have the "Adult"
   tag among their category tags.  To determine whether or
   not the tag is assigned to the current game, we start by
   retrieving the <a href="GameInfo.html#categories"><b>categories</b></a>
   property from the <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object
   that the system passes us on each call to the <b>select</b>
   function.  The <b>categories</b> property gives us an array
   of strings for all of the tags associated with the game, so
   we can use the Javascript array indexOf() function to search
   for the string of interest, "Adult".  If it's there, indexOf()
   will return the non-negative index of the position in the array
   where the string was found.  If it's <i>not</i> there, indexOf()
   returns -1.  We want to include the game in the selection if
   "Adult" isn't anywhere in the array, so we return true (meaning
   "yes, include this game") if indexOf() returns a
   negative value.
</p>

<p>
   Creating a filter immediately puts it into effect, so family
   mode is active as soon as we call enableFamilyFilter().  Now,
   we obviously want to be able to switch back to grown-up mode
   when the kids are away, so we also need a way to disable the
   filter after it's been created and placed into effect.
   That's also pretty straightforward:
</p>
<div class="code">
function disableFamilyFilter()
{
    // remove the filter
    gameList.removeMetaFilter(familyFilterId);
}
</div>

<p>
   When we want to remove the filter, we can simply call
   disableFamilyFilter().  Removing a metafilter immediately
   takes it out of effect, so removing the family filter will
   make the system stop excluding the "Adult"-tagged games.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the enable and disable
   functions both refer to a global variable that we snuck
   in before the enable function, <b>familyFilterId</b>.
   We use that to remember the ID of the filter that
   <a href="GameList.html#createMetaFilter">gameList.createMetaFilter()</a>
   returns, so that we can later pass that same ID to
   <a href="GameList.html#removeMetaFilter">gameList.removeMetaFilter()</a>
   when it's time to get rid of the filter.  It's crucial that
   we keep track of that ID, since it's the only way to tell
   the system to remove the filter later.
</p>
   


<h2>Adding the Operator Menu command</h2>

<p>
   Our filter is ready to go.  Now we just need to add the user
   interface to enable and disable it.
   Recall that our UI for the Family Filter is going to involve a new
   custom command in the Operator Menu.  Let's look at how to add that.
</p>
<p>
   The first step in adding any custom menu command is to create a
   command ID for the new command.  This ID connects the menu item we
   create to the command handler that will actually carry out the
   command when the user selects it.  When we create a command ID, we
   need to save it somewhere, usually a simple global Javascript variable.
</p>
<div class="code">
let familyFilterCommand = command.allocate("FamilyFilter");
</div>

<p>
   Once we have the ID, we can add the command to the desired menu.
   To do this, we write a handler for the Javascript "menuopen" event,
   which PinballY fires each time a menu is about to be displayed.
   This handler simply needs to insert the menu item at a desired
   position in the menu.  You can choose whatever location you like,
   but it seems sensible to me to group this command with the other
   filter-like commands, "Show Hidden Games" and "Show Unconfigured Games".
   So let's add it just before the "Show Hidden Games" command.
</p>
<div class="code">
let showHiddenCommand = gameList.getFilterInfo("Hidden").cmd;
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "operator") {
        ev.addMenuItem(showHiddenCommand, {
            title: "Family Filter",
            cmd: familyFilterCommand,
            checked: familyFilterOn
        });
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that we had to work a little harder than usual to figure out
   the command ID for the "Show Hidden Games" command.  That's because
   this is technically a filter command, and filter commands don't
   have fixed <a href="Commands.html#commandIDs"</a>command IDs</a>
   the way most other menu commands do.  To get the command ID for
   a filter command, we have to ask the filter.  Fortunately, that's
   pretty easy: just a matter of calling <a href="GameList.html#getFilterInfo">gameList.getFilterInfo()</a>
   with the ID of the filter, and grabbing the <b>cmd</b> property
   from the <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a> object it
   returns.
</p>

<p>
   Now we just have write the command handler for our new menu
   item.  We've already written the hard parts, where we do the real
   work of enabling and disabling the metafilter.  We just have to
   call those functions in response to the menu selection.
</p>
<div class="code">
// always start with the family filter activated
let familyFilterOn = true;
enableFamilyFilter();

// handle the Family Filter menu command
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == familyFilterCommand) {
        // toggle the current status
        familyFilterOn = !familyFilterOn;

        // enable or disable the filter according to the new status
        if (familyFilterOn)
            enableFamilyFilter();
        else
            disableFamilyFilter();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   We've written this so that the family filter is automatically
   activated each time you start the program.  This strikes me as
   the way most people with children would probably want it, so
   that you can be assured that it always starts up in the "safe"
   mode by default.  No one will be able to get it into "adult"
   mode until someone with access to the coin door key shows up.
</p>
<p>
   Some people might prefer to save and restore the setting.
   That is, if it's in adult mode when you quit a session, 
   it should start up
   again in adult mode the next time you run the program, rather
   than always returning to family mode.
   I personally think the original version above, where it's
   always in family mode at the start of a new session, is the
   right approach for this particular feature.  I wouldn't want to have to
   remember to always set the mode back to "safe" before shutting down.
   But the nice thing about Javascript customizations is that
   you don't have to agree with me on every little detail - you
   can make it work the way you want it to.
   So here's how we could rewrite the section above
   to save and restore the setting rather than always starting
   in family mode.
</p>


<div class="code">
// restore the saved setting
let familyFilterKey = "custom.FamilyFilterMode";
let familyFilterOn = optionSettings.getBool(familyFilterKey);

// if the saved setting is On, enable the filter immediately
if (familyFilterOn)
    enableFamilyFilter();

mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == familyFilterCommand) {
        // toggle the current setting, and save it in the options
        optionSettings.set(familyFilterKey, familyFilterOn = !familyFilterOn);

        // enable or disable the filter in the game list
        if (familyFilterOn)
            enableFamilyFilter();
        else
            disableFamilyFilter();
    }
});
</div>
