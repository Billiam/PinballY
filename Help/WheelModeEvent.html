<h1>WheelModeEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired whenever the program returns to the
   base "Wheel" user interface, after being in another modal UI state
   (showing a popup, showing a menu, in attract mode, running a game).
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
<ul>
   <li><b>wheelmode:</b> Fires when returning to the regular wheel UI.
   This event fires after the fact, so it's not cancelable.
</ul>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  It has no additional
   properties beyond the standard set.
