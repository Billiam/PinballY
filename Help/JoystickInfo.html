<h1>JoystickInfo Class</h1>

<p>
   A JoystickInfo object describes a joystick device, and lets you
   read the current button status and axis values from the device.
   You get these objects from <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The best way to handle button presses and axis value changes
   is via events (see <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a>).
   However, in some cases it might be necessary (or just more convenient)
   to poll the current status, such as within an interval timer or another
   type of event handler.  The JoystickInfo object makes that possible
   through the <b>button()</b> method and the various axis value reader
   methods. If you are going to use polling, and you're going to poll
   the device with any frequency, it's best to retrieve
   the JoystickInfo object once (from mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()),
   and keep a reference to it in a global variable or other
   location, so that you can reuse the same object each time you
   need to access the buttons or axis values.  Each call to
   getJoystickInfo() has to retrieve the internal joystick record
   and construct a new Javascript object with the descriptor
   information, so it's a little inefficient to create a new
   object every on every polling cycle.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to store settings related to a joystick across
   sessions, the best way to identify the joystick is via its
   Instance GUID.  That's a unique identifier that Windows assigns
   to each input device specifically for this purpose.  You can
   also identify the <i>type</i> of a device with the combination
   of its Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), and product name string,
   but that only tells you the type; it can't distinguish among
   multiple devices of the same type all plugged in at once.
</p>
<p>
   We use the term "HID" a few times in this chapter.  That stands
   for Human Interface Device, and it's the technical term that the
   USB specifications use to encompass all sorts of USB hardware
   devices that involve user input, including keyboards, mice,
   and joysticks.  As far as Windows is concerned, joysticks are
   just generic HIDs, so programs like PinballY that access them
   must do so in terms of the Windows HID programming interfaces.
   PinballY's Javascript interface to the joysticks tries to make
   things a little more straightforward by working in terms of
   more concrete, joystick-specific concepts.
   Even so, the generic HID foundation is still lurking beneath,
   so you'll see a few mentions of "HID" in the notes below.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   The JoystickInfo object has the following properties and methods:
</p>

<p>
   <b>axes:</b> An object describing all of the axes and controls
   that the joystick provides.  This doesn't tell you the current
   values of the axes; it just describes which axes are present
   and what their ranges of motion are.  The possible axes are
   the standard axis and control elements defined in the USB
   HID specification, as listed below.  (The "Usage Code" is
   a USB HID concept, which we include purely for reference
   purposes; see the notes on the <b>usage</b> property below for an
   explanation.)
   <table class="dataTable compact">
      <tr><th>Name</th><th>USB HID Usage Code</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>X</td><td>0x30</td><td>Main joystick X axis</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Y</td><td>0x31</td></td><td>Main joystick Y axis</tr>
      <tr><td>Z</td><td>0x32</td><td>Main joystick Z axis</td></tr>
      <tr><td>RX</td><td>0x33</td></td><td>X rotation</tr>
      <tr><td>RY</td><td>0x34</td><td>Y rotation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>RZ</td><td>0x35</td></td><td>Z rotation</tr>
      <tr><td>Slider</td><td>0x36</td><td>Slider control</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Dial</td><td>0x37</td></td><td>Dial control</tr>
      <tr><td>Wheel</td><td>0x38</td><td>Wheel control</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Hat</td><td>0x39</td></td><td>Hat switch</tr>
   </table>
   <p>
      The returned object has a property for each axis that exists
      on the device, named with the <b>Name</b> listed above.
      For example, if the device has an X axis, then <b><i>joystickInfo</i>.axes.X</b>
      will contain a descriptor for the X axis.  Each axis descriptor object
      has the following properties:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>name:</b> A string giving the name of the axis, from
      the list above.  This is also the name of the
      associated value reader method for that axis on the
      JoystickInfo object itself.

      <li><b>logicalMinimum:</b>  A number giving the "logical minimum"
      value for this axis.  Values returned from the axis reader method
      will always be in the range from <b>logicalMinimum</b> to <b>logicalMaximum</b>,
      inclusive.

      <li><b>logicalMaximum:</b>  A number giving the "logical maximum"
      value for this axis.  Values returned from the axis reader method
      will always be in the range from <b>logicalMinimum</b> to <b>logicalMaximum</b>,
      inclusive.

      <li><b>physicalMinimum:</b>  A number giving the "physical minimum"
      value for this axis.  This is the low end of the range for physical
      readings on the device.  Readings are adjusted to the logical range
      before being reported to the PC, though, so this is only included
      for the sake of completeness; you won't necessarily
      see values in the physical range returned from the axis reader method.

      <li><b>physicalMaximum:</b>  A number giving the "physical maximum"
      value for this axis.  This is the high end of the range for physical
      readings on the device.  Readings are adjusted to the logical range
      before being reported to the PC, though, so this is only included
      for the sake of completeness; you won't necessarily
      see values in the physical range returned from the axis reader method.

      <li><b>usage:</b>  A number giving the USB HID "usage" code
      for the axis.  "Usage" is a technical term in the USB HID spec that
      amounts to an integer ID value assigned in the HID spec
      for a particular purpose, in this case to define joystick control
      elements that report ranged values, like the X Axis or a Slider
      control.  Since the usage values are defined in the spec, they're
      permanent and universal, across all USB devices and all computers and
      operating systems that use USB.  The <b>usage</b> property value here
      is one of the control axis values defined under HID Usage Page 1,
      "Generic Desktop".  ("Usage Page" is another bit of USB jargon; it's
      not a page number in a book somewhere, but rather refers to a group
      of usage codes collected together in the spec.  A Usage code is only meaningful
      when combined with its Usage Page, the way that a person's first name
      has to be combined with their last name to have any hope of knowing
      which "Bob" you're talking about.  The same usage code can be used in
      many Usage Pages with completely unrelated meanings.  For joystick
      devices, all usage codes are in Usage Page 1.)
      Each usage code corresponds to a <b>name</b>
      value listed above, so you can use the <b>name</b> string as an
      equally unambiguous identifier for the axis.  But the names aren't part
      of the USB spec; they're just friendlier IDs that we assigned for
      PinballY purposes.
   </ul>
</p>
<p>
   The <b>axes</b> value is only accurate if the device is currently attached,
   and it's only a snapshot of the axis list at the time the JoystickInfo
   object was created.  If the device is currently unplugged or disabled,
   and you plug it in at some point after retrieving a JoystickInfo object
   for the device, that JoystickInfo object won't be updated to reflect
   the actual axis list of the live device.  You'd need to make a new call to
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>
   to create a fresh JoystickInfo object to get the updated axis information once
   the device is plugged in.
</p>

<p>
   <b>button(<i>index</i>):</b>  This method returns the current button
   press status for the given button number.  This should be
   one of the numbers that appears in the <b>buttons</b>
   array, since that contains a full list of all of the available
   buttons on the device.  The return value is <b>true</b> if the
   button is currently pressed, <b>false</b> if not.  If the button
   isn't one of the valid buttons for the device, the method
   returns <b>undefined</b>.
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>buttons:</b>  An array of numbers, listing all of the buttons that
   the joystick has.  Joystick buttons are simply numbered, usually starting
   at 1.
</p>
<p>
   The button array is only accurate if the device is currently attached,
   and it's only a snapshot of the button list at the time the JoystickInfo
   object was created.  If the device is currently unplugged or disabled,
   and you plug it in at some point after retrieving a JoystickInfo object
   for the device, that JoystickInfo object won't be updated to reflect
   the actual button list of the live device.  You'd need to make a new call to
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>
   to create a fresh JoystickInfo object to get the updated button list once
   the device is plugged in.
</p>

<p>
   <b>guid:</b>  A string giving the DirectInput "Instance GUID" for the
   device, if available.  This is formatted in the standard Windows GUID style
   (without braces), "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000".  This is set to
   <b>undefined</b> if no GUID is available for the device.
</p>
<p>
   The Instance GUID is meant to uniquely identify the device across sessions
   and system reboots, so it's suitable to use for storing configuration
   settings and other persistent data related to the device.
</p>

<p>
   <b>isPresent:</b>  A boolean (true/false) indicating whether or not
   this joystick is physically connected to the computer and enabled in
   Windows Device Manager.  The reason this property is useful is that PinballY
   keeps track of joysticks that have been configured in the settings with
   commands assigned to their buttons, and lists such joysticks in the array
   of all joysticks, even if they aren't currently plugged in.  That lets
   PinballY restore joystick button mappings across sessions even if a joystick
   is temporarily unplugged.  This property lets you determine if the descriptor
   refers to such a saved device record rather than to a device that's
   actually present in the system right now.  (This is a read-only "getter"
   that retrieves the live status each time you evaluate it, so it's always
   up-to-date.)
</p>
<p>
   This property is only a snapshot of the status as of the time the JoystickInfo
   object was created.  It's not "live" - it's not updated if the device is
   later plugged in or unplugged.  To get the current status, you need to
   create a new JoystickInfo object for the device by calling
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a> again.
</p>

<p>
   <b>path:</b> A string giving the Windows file system path that represents
   the device in the file system.  This is superficially similar to a regular
   filename, but it represents the device object rather than a disk file.
   You can use this to access the device via lower-level Windows API
   functions such as CreateFile().  This can also serve as a stable identifier
   for the device, although the Instance GUID is better for that purposes,
   since it's specifically designed to be stable across system reboots.
   The device's file path sometimes contains information on the physical
   bus location of the device, such as which USB port it's plugged into,
   so it can change if something about the USB bus layout changes or you plug
   the device into a different USB port.
</p>

<p>
   <b>productID:</b>  A 16-bit integer (0 to 65535) giving the USB PID
   (product ID).  This can be used in combination with the
   vendor ID to uniquely identify the make and model of the device.  The
   product ID is an arbitrary code assigned by the manufacturer, and is
   meant to be unique for each device they make.
</p>

<p>
   <b>productName:</b>  A string giving the product name, as provided
   by the device's firmware.  This is usually a human-readable name
   describing the make and model, but it's up to the device's manufacturer
   to specify this string and embed it in the device's firmware.  It's
   even possible for a device to omit this information, in which case
   PinballY synthesizes a placeholder name based on the VID and PID values.
</p>

<p>
   <b>serial:</b>  A string giving the USB device's serial number.  This is
   information reported by the device's firmware, meant to help distinguish
   multiple instances of the same type of device (e.g., two joysticks of
   the same make and model).  This is up to the device's firmware to
   provide, so there's no guarantee that every device will have a unique
   serial number.
</p>

<p>
   <b>setAxisRange(<i>axisName</i>, <i>min</i>, <i>max</i>):</b> Sets a
   normalized value range for the named axis.  <i>axisName</i> is a
   string containing one of the standard axis names listed earlier,
   such as "X" or "Slider".  <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> are numbers
   giving new, normalized range you wish to use for the axis.  After
   calling this method, the axis reader function will return values
   in the range from <i>min</i> to <i>max</i> inclusive.  For
   example, here's how you can set the X axis to return values
   from -1000 to +1000:
</p>
<div class="code">
js.setAxisRange("X", -1000, 1000);
let x = js.X();  // X() now returns values from -1000 to +1000
</div>
<p>
   You can change the range for an axis at any time simply by making
   a new call to setAxisRange().  You can also reset to the original
   underlying "logical" range that the device returns natively by
   calling setAxisRange() again and omitting the <i>min</i> and <i>max</i>
   arguments, as in <b>setAxisRange("X")</b>.
</p>
<p>
   This setting is "local" to the JoystickInfo object that you call the
   method on.  It doesn't affect the underlying joystick device,
   and it doesn't even affect any other JoystickInfo objects that refer
   to the same physical device.  The range setting is just a view of
   the data for this individual JoystickInfo object.
</p>

<p>
   <b>unit:</b>  The PinballY logical unit number for the joystick.  This is
   an arbitrary internal ID that PinballY uses to identify the joystick 
   during the current program session.  It corresponds to the <b>unit</b>
   property passed in joystick event objects.  This ID doesn't mean anything
   to Windows or to any other programs (it's purely internal to PinballY), and
   it's only valid for the duration of the current program session (the same
   physical device might be assigned a different logical unit number the next
   time you run PinballY).
</p>

<p>
   <b>vendorID:</b>  A 16-bit integer (0 to 65535) giving the USB VID
   (vendor ID).  This can be used in combination with the
   product ID to uniquely identify the make and model of the device.
</p>
<p>
   A VID is meant to uniquely identify the device's manufacturer.
   Officially, VIDs are assigned by a central authority, USB-IF,
   which is the industry trade group that controls the USB specifications.
   VIDs should therefore never be ambiguous.  In practice, though, some
   device makers use ad hoc, self-assigned VIDs, because a hefty license
   fee is required to obtain a official VID assignment.  (As far as I can
   tell, for example, the LedWiz's VID is unofficial.)  As a result, you
   can't absolutely count on the VID as a unique manufacturer identification,
   in that multiple device makers could accidentally self-assign themselves
   the same VID.   If you need to identify an exact device, you might want
   to check other properties in addition to the VID/PID, such as the product
   name string and serial number, to make sure they match the expected
   values and formats for the target device.
</p>

<h2>Axis/control value reader methods</h2>

<p>
   In addition to the properties and methods listed above, the JoystickInfo
   object also has a method for each axis/control value listed under the
   <b>axes</b> property.  Each axis reader method has the name listed under
   the <b>Name</b> column in the axis list.
</p>
<p>
   Calling one of the axis reader methods retrieves the current, live value
   for that axis.  This returns a number, which is in the "logical" value
   range for the axis.  You can determine the range from the <b>logicalMinimum</b>
   and <b>logicalMaximum</b> properties of the descriptor object for the
   axis or control found in the <b>axes</b> array.
</p>
<p>
   If a given axis doesn't exist on the device, calling that axis reader
   method returns <b>undefined</b>.
</p>
<p>
   For example, here's how you'd retrieve the current X and Y axis values
   for the joystick at unit 0:
</p>
<div class="code">
let js = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(0);
let x = js.X();
let y = js.Y();
</div>

<h3>Normalizing an axis's value range</h3>
<p>
   By default, each axis returns values in the logical value range for the axis.
   The logical range is defined by the device - there's no generic standard
   for this.  Some joysticks might report X values from 0 to +1000, while
   others might report values from -65535 to +65535.  The only way to
   determine the range is to look at the axis information in the device
   descriptor.
</p>
<p>
   It's almost always more convenient to work in terms of a range
   <i>you</i> select, though.  The easiest way to do this is to call
   the <b>setAxisRange()</b> method to set up the desired range on
   each axis.
</p>
<p>
   You can also normalize axis ranges yourself, with a little arithmetic.
   Here's a general formula you can use to convert from the logical
   range to an abstract range of 0.0 to 1.0:
</p>
<div class="code">
let xNorm = (x - js.axes.X.logicalMinimum) / (js.axes.X.logicalMaximum - js.axes.X.logicalMinimum);
</div>
<p>
   We can take this a step further, to convert from the logical range
   to any desired new range:
</p>
<div class="code">
// change xMin and xMax to whatever limits you prefer
let xMin = -1000;
let xMax = 1000;
let xNorm = (x - js.axes.X.logicalMinimum) / (js.axes.X.logicalMaximum - js.axes.X.logicalMinimum);
xNorm = xNorm*(xMax - xMin) + xMin;
</div>

<p>
   Finally, rather than writing this out every time we want to perform the
   normalization, we can create a method on the joystick descriptor object
   that does this work under the covers for us.  In fact, since the joystick
   object inherits the axis reader from its prototype, we can easily replace
   the original value reader method with a new method of the same name that
   returns the normalized result instead of the logical range:
</p>
<div class="code">
let xMin = -1000;
let xMax = 1000;
js.X = function() {
    // get the "inherited" value, in the original logical range
    // (yes, Javascript's expression of "inherited" is kind of ugly)
    let x = this.constructor.prototype.X.call(this);

    // normalize it
    x = (x - this.axes.X.logicalMinimum) / (this.axes.X.logicalMaximum - this.axes.X.logicalMinimum);
    return x*(xMax - xMin) + xMin;
};
</div>
<p>
   That plugs the new X() method into the object, which overrides
   the one inherited from the system.  The replacement method calls
   the original inherited method, normalizes the value it reads,
   and then returns the result.  This is actually the same thing
   that setAxisRange() does, so you can just call that system
   method in most cases.  But if you want to do something trickier
   than just normalizing to a new linear scale, you can use this
   general approach to perform whatever manipulations you want on
   the raw "logical" values reported from the device.
