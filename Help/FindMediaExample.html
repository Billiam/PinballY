<h1>Custom "Find Media" Menu</h1>

<p>
   One of the functions in the Game Setup menu is "Find game media
   online", which brings up a Web browser with a Google search
   term that looks for a HyperPin Media Pack for the current game.
   This is designed to make it quick and easy to find the basic
   media items (wheel image, promotional flyer, instruction cards)
   for a game.
</p>
<p>
   I heard from a user who wanted to augment this function with a
   local search.  He explained that he has a large collection of
   these media pack on his hard disk, so it's often more convenient
   for him to do a "local" search for something he's already
   downloaded than to look on the Web.  I can understand why
   this would be useful for him, but it seemed like a difficult
   idea to generalize into a built-in feature, because everyone
   has their own way of arranging their disk files.  That made it
   look like a good candidate for a Javascript feature, since
   that approach would make it easy to customize for
   different setups.
</p>
<p>
   In this example, we'll supplement the "Find media online"
   menu with a new command that opens the local Downloads
   folder.  We'll keep the online search command as well,
   so adding this extension lets you choose each time where
   to look.  You could further customize the example to look
   in a different folder (other than Downloads), or to add
   extra commands to open other local folders.
</p>
<p>
   The menu we're going to customize is the one that comes up when
   you select "Find game media online" from the Game Setup menu.
   Here's what the normal, built-in version of that menu looks like:
</p>
<img class="example" src="FindMediaOnlineMenu.png">
<p>
   That menu obviously doesn't do much; it's really only there to
   remind you that you'll have to take some manual action after
   switching to the Web browser to view the search results,
   since PinballY won't have a way to interact with you once
   the browser is in the foreground.  Even though the menu doesn't
   do much right now, though, it does provide a natural place to
   add our new search option.
</p>
<p>
   Our main task in this example will be to add a new command, "Open
   Downloads Folder", after the existing "Search" command.  This
   really takes two tasks: the first is to modify the menu, and the
   second is to actually implement the new command.  In addition,
   we'll make a couple of small cosmetic changes to the menu to adapt
   the text to reflect that there are more options present.
</p>

<h2>Creating a new command ID</h2>

<p>
   Before we start modifying the menu, there's a small detail that
   always goes with creating new commands.  Each menu item needs a
   "command ID", which PinballY uses to connect the menu item to
   the code that carries out the command.  The ID is just an
   arbitrary integer value.  PinballY assigns its own IDs to all
   of the built-in commands (you can find a full list in
   <a href="Commands.html#systemCommandIDs">Commands</a>), but
   since we're adding a new command
   that didn't exist before, we're responsible for assigning it a
   new ID.  We only have to do this step once, at the start of the
   program session, so we put this code at the "top level" of the
   file, outside of any functions.  We'll save the new ID in a
   global variable so that we can reference it later.
</p>
<div class="code">
// create our custom command ID, for identifying our newly defined
// command in a menu
let openDownloadsCommand = command.allocate("OpenDownloadsFolder");
</div>


<h2>Customizing the menu</h2>


<p>
   The way to modify a system menu is to listen for the
   <a href="MenuEvent.html">menuopen</a> event.  That gets fired
   each time a menu is open.  The event contains an ID telling
   us which menu is being opened, so our listener starts by
   checking the ID to see if this is the menu we want to change.
   From the <a href="Menus.html#systemMenus">list of system menus</a>,
   we can see that the ID for the menu of interest in this
   case is "media search".
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "media search") {
        // put the code to customize the menu here
        // TO DO
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Our main task here is to insert our new "Open Downloads Folder"
   command after the existing "Search" command.  So we have to find
   the "Search" command.  The event contains an <b>items</b> property
   containing the list of menu items that the system proposes to
   display, so we just have to search that list for that item.  The
   best way to identify the item is via its command ID.  We could
   check the title string instead, but that's not a good idea, because
   the title could be tweaked in a future version, or it could be
   translated into another language for a localized version.  The
   command ID is more universal.
</p>
<p>
   Once we find the existing "Search" item, we can use Javascript's
   array "splice" method to insert our new item just after it.
<div class="code">
let i = ev.items.findIndex(item => item.cmd == command.FindMediaGo);
if (i >= 0) {
    ev.items.splice(i+1, 0, { title: "Open Downloads Folder", cmd: openDownloadsCommand });
}
</div>
<p>
   Notice that we referred to the global variable that we used to
   save the new command ID we assigned earlier.
</p>
<p>
   There's actually a slightly easier way to add a menu item, thanks
   to a method in the event object itself called <a href="MenuEvent.html#addMenuItem">addMenuItem()</a>.
   This method does exactly the same thing we just did to the items array
   manually, but without having to write quite so much code on our
   part.  We could use it to replace the lines above with a
   somewhat simpler and clearer version:
</p>
<div class="code">
ev.addMenuItem({ after: command.FindMediaGo },
    { title: "Open Downloads Folder", cmd: openDownloadsCommand });
</div>

<p>
   As long as we're messing with the menu, let's make a couple of small
   cosmetic changes to the existing text.  That big explanatory
   paragraph at the top isn't quite right now that there's another
   option besides searching the Web, so let's touch it up to reflect
   the new reality.  Note that explanatory text like this is always
   in the first "items" slot, so we don't need to bother with a
   search this time.
</p>
<div class="code">
ev.items[0].title =
    "Would you like to launch a Web browser to find a Media Pack " +
    "for the game online, or search your existing Downloads folder?";
</div>

<p>
   Let's also change the title of the existing "Search" item to make
   it clear that this is the <i>Web</i> search option, now that we
   also have an option to search locally.  We'll squeeze this line
   into the bracketed section in the "if" above.
</p>
<div class="code">
ev.items[i].title = "Search the Web";
</div>

<p>
   There's one final step before we return, which is to tell PinballY
   that we modified the menu.  For the sake of efficiency, the system
   doesn't bother checking for changes to the item array unless you
   set this flag in the event object.
</p>
<div class="code">
// tell PinballY that we made changes to the menu
ev.menuUpdated = true;
</div>

<p>
   Putting it all together, here's our full listener:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "media search") {
        // The first item in the menu is the explanatory text.  The
        // standard text explains how to drop a Media Pack file onto
        // the window after downloading it from the Web search.  Change
        // the text a bit to reflect the additional options we're adding.
        ev.items[0].title =
            "Would you like to launch a Web browser to find a Media Pack " +
            "for the game online, or search your existing Downloads folder?";

        // Find the "Search" command in the menu
        let i = ev.items.findIndex(item => item.cmd == command.FindMediaGo);
        if (i >= 0) {
            // since we're adding a new command alongside "Search", change
            // its title to make it clearer what it does in contrast to the
            // new command we're adding
            ev.items[i].title = "Search the Web";

            // insert our Downloads folder command immediately after Search
            ev.items.splice(i+1, 0, { title: "Open Downloads Folder", cmd: openDownloadsCommand });
        }

        // tell the system to use our updated menu
        ev.menuUpdated = true;
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that it might have been a little easier in this case to just
   replace the whole menu outright, by supplying a whole new array for "items".
   That would eliminate the need to search for the "Search" item.  But
   I think it's always better to use the modification approach we
   chose here, because that adapts more readily to
   any future changes to the system menu.  For example, if a future
   version of PinballY adds its own new commands to this menu, you'll
   see them show up on your modified menu automatically, because the
   listener always starts with whatever the system is going to use by
   default and then adds to it.  That wouldn't happen if we replaced the
   menu entirely.
</p>

<h2>Opening the Downloads folder</h2>

<p>
   Okay, the menu is all set - the next time you open it, you'll see
   the new command.  But selecting that command won't actually do anything
   yet, because we still have to write the code to carry it out.
</p>
<p>
   The place to handle a menu command is in a
   <a href="CommandEvent.html">command</a> event listener.  The system
   fires that event each time the user selects a command from a menu
   (or by any other means, such as pressing a key assigned to the
   command).   The event contains
   an ID telling us which command is being executed.  We can test that
   against the global variable we used to store the command ID we
   assigned for our custom command.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == openDownloadsCommand) {
        // TO DO - carry out the command
    }
}
</div>

<p>
   Opening the current user's Downloads involves a bit of arcane Windows
   API work.  But that's not an obstacle!  PinballY gives you access to nearly
   any Windows API via the <a href="DllImport.html">dllImport</a> system.
   The upside is that you can carry out almost any Windows function that
   you could write in C++ or C# or any other language; the downside is that
   you have to know your way around the complexities of the Windows API.
</p>
<p>
   This isn't a tutorial for Windows API programming, so we won't go into
   the details of how all of these API calls work.  But we did promise a
   complete example, so let's lay out the full code required.
</p>
<p>
   The first piece is to "bind" all of the Windows API calls we need to
   make.  Like the global variable assignment we did earlier for our new
   command ID, this is one-time-only work that we do at the top level
   of the file, outside of any functions.
</p>
<div class="code">
// Set up some native Windows SDK functions we need in order to
// open the Downloads folder.
let Shell32 = dllImport.bind("Shell32.dll", `
    HINSTANCE WINAPI SHGetKnownFolderPath(
        REFIID riid,
        DWORD dwFlags,
        HANDLE hToken,
        LPWSTR *ppszPath);
    HINSTANCE WINAPI ShellExecuteW(
        HWND hwnd,
        LPCWSTR lpOperation,
        LPCWSTR lpFile,
        LPCWSTR lpParameters,
        LPCWSTR lpDirectory,
        INT nShowCmd);
    `);
let Ole32 = dllImport.bind("Ole32.dll", `
    void WINAPI CoTaskMemFree(void *pv);
`);
</div>

<p>
   I know that looks like gibberish if you're not familiar with
   the Windows API, but if it's any consolation, this is 
   all just copied and pasted from the standard Windows API headers.
   If there's an API call you want to make, you can usually just
   find the definition in the headers and copy it; you don't have
   to make these things up yourself.
   The <a href="DllImport.html">dllImport</a> mechanism uses the same
   C++ syntax that the Windows headers use, specifically so that you
   can mostly copy the function definitions from the Windows headers
   verbatim.
</p>

<p>
   With those system API bindings in place, we can now write the full
   command handler.  The basic strategy here is that we have to ask
   Windows for the file system path to the Downloads folder, then ask
   the desktop shell (Windows Explorer) to open that folder for us.
   Here's the full command event listener:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == openDownloadsCommand) {
        // Look up the folder path for the "known folder" Downloads.  The
        // ID string is a magic number defined by Microsoft; it's listed
        // (along with the IDs for all of the other special folders, such
        // as Documents, Pictures, Program Files, etc) in the Win32 SDK
        // documentation under the KNOWNFOLDERID type.  This sort of 
        // magic number is known as a UUID, for Universally Unique ID,
        // and it has the important property that it's permanent across
        // all time and space.  It seems like the sort of number that
        // might change in different versions of Windows, or on different
        // people's computers, but that's guaranteed not to happen; by
        // design, it's a permanent and universal ID for this folder.
        //
        // Note that the API call requires us to pass the address of
        // a native string pointer; it allocates memory for the string
        // and passes us back a pointer in that memory location.  It's
        // a little cumbersome in Javascript because we have to allocate
        // a spot for the pointer to be stored, as a native LPWSTR value.
        let downloadsFolderIID = "374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B";
        let path = dllImport.create("LPWSTR");
        Shell32.SHGetKnownFolderPath(downloadsFolderIID, 0, null,
            NativeObject.addressOf(path));

        // now use ShellExecute to "open" that path, which will show
        // a Windows Explorer window on the folder
        Shell32.ShellExecuteW(null, "open",
            path.value.toStringZ(), null, null, SW_SHOW);

        // We need to explicitly dispose of the memory used for the
        // path string that SHGetKnownFolderPath created for us, via
        // CoTaskMemFree.  (This isn't something we're supposed to
        // just "know"; the documentation for SHGetKnownFolderPath
        // tells us to do this.)
        Ole32.CoTaskMemFree(path.value);

        // finish with a message similar to the one that the normal
        // "Search the Web" command shows after opening a browser
        mainWindow.message(
            "When you find a media pack for this game, you can " +
            "install it simply by dragging and dropping it into " +
            "this window", "info");
    }
});
</div>
