<h1>PopupEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when a popup is about to be displayed,
   or when a popup is closed.
</p>
<p>
   This event has two subtypes:
<ul>
   <li><b>popupopen:</b> Fires when a new popup is about to be displayed.
   This is fired before the popup is shown (and before any side effects of
   showing it occur, such as removing a menu or a prior popup that was
   already showing).  If you cancel it by calling preventDefault(), the
   popup isn't displayed, and any side effects are skipped.

   <li><b>popupclose:</b>  Fires after a popup has been closed.  This is
   fired after the fact, so the event can't be canceled.
</ul>

<p>
   When a new popup replaces an old popup, the "open" event for the new
   popup will occur before the "close" event for the old popup.  The
   events occur in this order (which might seem a little surprising)
   because the proximate cause of the old popup closing is the opening
   of the new popup, and it's not a foregone conclusion that the new
   popup will open at all until the "open" event returns without
   canceling the new popup.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  In addition, it has
   the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b>  A string with the ID of the popup.  See <a href="Popups.html">Popups</a>
   for a list of the system popup IDs.

</ul>

</body>
</html>
