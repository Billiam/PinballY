<h1>"TT" High Score Backgrounds</h1>

<p>
   The "TT" (typewriter) high score style is designed for older games
   from the electromechanical era.  Games from that era didn't usually
   have any sort of high-score memory built into the machines themselves,
   since it would have been too complex and bulky to build that kind
   of circuitry using mechanical score reels.  So if anyone kept track
   of high scores at all, it was by writing down them down on bits of
   paper and sticking them to the machines.  The "TT" style is designed
   to re-create that effect by showing typewriter text on an index-card
   background.
</p>
<p>
   If you prefer to replace the default index-card background with something
   else, you can provide your own custom image file as described below.
</p>
<p>
   You can also customize the font and text color used for the TT-style
   high score display cards.  See the <b>TT High Scores</b> item in
   <a href="FontOptions.html">Font and Color Options</a>.
</p>

<h2>Folder location</h2>
<p>
   A custom background image for the "TT" high score style goes in the
   <b>Images</b> folder within your main Media folder.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="Customizing.html#mediaFolder">Media folder location</a>
   for more on where that folder is located.
</p>

<h2>File name</h2>

<p>
   The filename for a custom "TT" background image is
   <b>TT High Score Background.<i>ext</i></b>, where <i>.ext</i>
   is one of the standard image file extensions.
</p>

<h2>File types</h2>
<p>
   The extension can be any of the standard
   image file suffixes: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif.
