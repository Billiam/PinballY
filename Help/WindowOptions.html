<h1>Window Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Keep the DMD window in front of the backglass window:</b>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will make sure that its DMD window
   is always displayed in front of the backglass window.  Even if
   you click the mouse on the backglass window, the DMD window
   will still stay in front of it.  By default (if the box isn't
   checked), the DMD window follows the normal Windows UI rules
   where you can bring other windows in front of it by clicking
   on them, and you can bring the DMD window back in front by
   clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
   This option might be handy if you're using a single-monitor
   or two-monitor setup and you're positioning both the backglass
   and DMD on the same monitor.  (In the more typical pin cab setup,
   where you have three separate monitors - playfield, backglass,
   and DMD - the respective layering of these windows is kind of
   irrelevant since the windows are all on separate monitors anyway.)
</p>
<p>
   Note that this option only affects the <b>PinballY</b> DMD
   window and backglass window.  It doesn't have any effect on
   DMD windows displayed by other programs, such as the "virtual DMD"
   window in Freezy's dmd-extensions system, or the VPinMAME DMD
   window that appears while you're playing a Visual Pinball game,
   or the B2S Backglass Server DMD window that might also appear
   while a VP game is running.  It also doesn't affect the layering
   of backglass windows from other programs, such as the B2S
   Backglass Server window.
