<h1>Window Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Keep the DMD window in front of the backglass window:</b>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will make sure that its DMD window
   is always displayed in front of the backglass window.  Even if
   you click the mouse on the backglass window, the DMD window
   will still stay in front of it.  By default (if the box isn't
   checked), the DMD window follows the normal Windows UI rules
   where you can bring other windows in front of it by clicking
   on them, and you can bring the DMD window back in front by
   clicking on it.
</p>
<p>
   This option might be handy if you're using a single-monitor
   or two-monitor setup and you're positioning both the backglass
   and DMD on the same monitor.  (In the more typical pin cab setup,
   where you have three separate monitors - playfield, backglass,
   and DMD - the respective layering of these windows is kind of
   irrelevant since the windows are all on separate monitors anyway.)
</p>
<p>
   Note that this option only affects the <b>PinballY</b> DMD
   window and backglass window.  It doesn't have any effect on
   DMD windows displayed by other programs, such as the "virtual DMD"
   window in Freezy's dmd-extensions system, or the VPinMAME DMD
   window that appears while you're playing a Visual Pinball game,
   or the B2S Backglass Server DMD window that might also appear
   while a VP game is running.  It also doesn't affect the layering
   of backglass windows from other programs, such as the B2S
   Backglass Server window.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Keep the playfield window in front of other applications during launch:</b>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will make its windows "Topmost"
   during the process of launching a game - that is, between the time
   you select the "Play" command and the time the game displays its
   main window.  "Topmost" is a special status in Windows that
   keeps a window in front of other non-topmost windows - even in
   front of an active window.  This more or less guarantees that
   other windows won't be visible until the game has started.
</p>
<p>
   This option is intended to make for smoother visual transitions
   during game launch if you experience any problems
   with windows belonging to other applications (besides PinballY
   and the game itself) popping into the foreground during launch.
   Ideally, we want the PinballY window to be the only thing visible
   until the game is ready.  But other applications don't always
   cooperate with this plan, thus this option.  I've seen
   problems on Windows 7 in particular where random other
   windows can come to the foreground during the launch process.
</p>
<p>
   This option is a rather heavy-handed workaround, and
   I'd only enable it if you actually experience problems
   with other windows appearing in front of PinballY during launch.  The sort
   of forced layering that this option uses can cause problems of
   its own.  The PinballY windows
   really should stay in front during launch naturally, without this
   option enabled.  But if they don't, this might be worth a try.
