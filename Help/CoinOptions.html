<h1>Coin Options</h1>

<p>
   PinballY simulates a coin-op arcade game by accepting coins and converting
   them to "credits".  Credits are added when you insert coins, and credits
   are deducted when you launch games.  This is purely a novelty feature, for
   the sake of arcade simulation; the coins and credits aren't used for anything
   other than this accounting for its own sake.  If this seems like a pointless
   detail to you, you're right, and you can just skip this batch of options.
   But if you're amused by the simulation aspect, this dialog lets you customize
   the "pricing model" to match your local currency and your preferred
   era of pinball.
</p>
<p>
   The coin/credit counter is internal to PinballY.  It doesn't
   carry over to the pinball tables you launch with PinballY.  Each table
   uses its own internal counter, and there's no way to transfer the credit
   information back and forth between the tables and the menu system.  That's
   the big limitation that makes this a novelty feature only.
</p>

<h2>Coin slot values</h2>

<p>
   The first step to setting up pricing is to specify the currency value for
   each type of coin that your machine accepts.  The "Coin slot N" entries
   correspond to the "Coin N" switches you can set up in the Buttons dialog.
   If you have a typical US coin door with two slots that both accept
   quarters, for example, you could just set up all of the slots with a
   currency value of 0.25, for a quarter dollar.  If you have a 1960s coin
   door with dime and quarter slots, you can set up one slot with a 0.10
   value and one with a 0.25 value.
</p>

<h2>Pricing model</h2>

<p>
   The second step, after setting up the coin slot currency values, is
   to set up the "pricing model".  This is where you specify how the
   currency values are converted to credits.
</p>
<p>
   You can select one of the pre-defined models from the
   drop list, or you can enter a completely custom model.  The list
   has entries for the most common models used since the 1980s in the US.
   If you select one of the pre-defined models, the price points for
   that model will appear in the "Coin/credit levels" box.
</p>
<p>
   The key to understanding how the coin/credit list works is to know
   that there are two separate counters inside PinballY:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <b>coin balance</b>, which keeps track of the total value
   of coins that have been inserted.  For example, if you insert three
   quarters, the coin balance will be 0.75.

   <li>The <b>credit balance</b>, which keeps track of coins that
   have been fully converted to credits.
</ul>
<p>
   The information that you enter in the coin/credit list
   works in terms of the coin balance.  The list consists of a
   series of price points and the corresponding number of credits. 
</p>
<p>
   Each time you insert a coin, PinballY adds the coin's value to the
   total coin balance.  It then looks up the current coin balance in
   the pricing model list.  It finds the highest coin value from the
   list that can be bought with the current coin balance, and it
   counts it as the corresponding number of credits.  When the coin
   balance reaches or exceeds the highest value level in the list,
   PinballY converts that much of the coin balance into a credit
   balance, reducing the coin balance accordingly.
</p>
<p>
   To enter a pricing model, simply enter a series of lines consisting
   of one coin value and one credit value per line.  The coin values
   should be in ascending order.  For example, one common model in the
   US is 50&cent; for the one credit, 75&cent; for two credits, or
   $1.00 for three credits.  You can enter this like so:
</p>
<pre>
   0.25  .5
   0.50  1
   0.75  2
   1.00  3
</pre>
<p>
   Note that we entered a line for a half-credit for 25&cent; (the
   first line, <tt>0.25 .5</tt>).  That's for the sake of giving the
   user some feedback when she drops in the first coin, the same way
   most real pinball machines would.
</p>

<h2>Max credits</h2>

<p>
   This box lets you set an upper limit to the number of credits that
   can be accumulated.  Most real pinball machines have a limit of 10
   credits or so.
