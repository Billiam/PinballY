<h1>CommandButtonEvent</h1>

<p>
   This Event subclass is similar to <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a> and
   <a href="JoystickEvent.html">JoystickEvent</a>, but represents a
   notional "command" button, which is what a physical key press
   turns into after being translated into the PinballY command
   that's assigned to the physical key that was actually pressed.
   This event lets you work in terms of the assigned meaning of
   a key rather than in terms of the physical key.  Since PinballY
   lets users reassign commands to whichever keys they want, the
   physical key pressed is often irrelevant to a program function;
   the assigned command is often all that matters.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   When the user presses a physical key, it goes through several
   steps of processing.  These steps generate Javascript events
   that you can monitor:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A "keydown" or "joystickbuttondown" event is generated for
   the physical key.  (The "bg" equivalent is used instead if the
   program is running in the background.)  This gives you a chance
   to take action according to the actual physical key pressed,
   regardless of which command it's assigned to, or whether it's
   assigned to a command at all.

   <li>PinballY determines if the key is assigned to any command(s)
   in the settings.  If so, it puts the command in a queue for
   processing.  If not, no Command Button events will be generated
   for the key, but you'll still see the physical key events.

   <li>When it's time to process the command, a "commandbuttondown"
   (or the "bg" equivalent) is generated for the mapped command.
   It doesn't matter to PinballY which physical key generated
   the command at this point, so this event only has the mapped
   command, with no information on the original key that was
   pressed.  This event lets you work in terms of the assigned
   meaning of the key, regardless of which physical key was used
   to generate the command.
</ul>

<p>
   As with key and joystick events, a "button down" event is sent
   when the user presses the button, and a "button up" event is
   sent when the user releases the button.  A command button event
   can also auto-repeat if the user holds down the originating key.
</p>
<p>
   The default processing that PinballY does almost always ignores
   the "up" events; commands are generally only triggered by
   key press events.  PinballY repeats some command actions on
   auto-repeat events, such as moving through the game wheel with
   the next/previous keys, and it ignores auto-repeats for
   some other commands.  Regardless of the internal response,
   though, the sequence of Command Button events - button down,
   repeat button down, button up - is always generated the
   same way for all keys with commands assigned.
</p>
<p>
   The settings allow a single physical key to be mapped to
   more than one command.  When a key with multiple assigned
   commands is pressed, the program fires multiple Command
   Button events - one per assigned command - for the same
   physical key press.  The only button that's commonly
   mapped to multiple commands is the Exit button, which
   is usually mapped to both the "Exit" command and the
   "Exit Game" command.  However, the ability to map
   multiple commands to a key isn't restricted to that
   case and could be applied to any key and any combination
   of commands.
</p>

<p>
   There are four command button event subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>commandbuttondown:</b> Fires when a key mapped to a
   command is pressed while the application is in the foreground.
   Fires again each time the key auto-repeats.

   <li><b>commandbuttonup:</b> Fires when a key mapped to a command
   is released and the application is in the foreground.

   <li><b>commandbuttonbgdown:</b>  Fires when a key mapped to
   a command is pressed while the application is in the background,
   and again on each auto-repeat.

   <li><b>commandbuttonbgup:</b>  Fires when a command key is
   released while the application is in the background.
</ul>

<h2>How this event differs from raw keyboard events</h2>

<p>
   In many cases, the relationship between raw keyboard events and
   Command Button events is one-to-one.  But it's not always,
   which is the whole reason that the CommandButton event is exposed
   as a separate event from the raw keyboard event.
</p>
<p>
   There are two main places where the two event types can differ.
</p>
<p>
   The first is the fairly obvious one:  most keys aren't mapped
   to commands in the user's settings, so most keys won't generate
   CommandButton events at all.  We wanted Javascript
   to have access to all of the low-level keyboard events, for
   greater flexibility in customizing the program, so we had to
   provide Javascript events for all keys, whether mapped to
   commands or not.  That's why the raw key events are there.
   We also wanted to simplify things for Javascript code that
   only cares about the abstract commands, which is why the
   CommandButton events are also there.
</p>
<p>
   The second difference between raw key events and CommandButton
   events is more complex, and has to do with auto-repeat handling.
   At the raw hardware level, Windows generates auto-repeat events
   at fixed intervals, no matter how quickly or slowly the
   application wants to process the repeat events.
   Windows stores the repeats in a buffer until the application
   processes them.  These timed repeat events are reflected in
   the raw keyboard events in Javascript.  CommandButton events
   also can auto-repeat, but their auto-repeat timing is
   determined by PinballY, according to the rate at which
   PinballY wants to process the repeats.  The simple timing scheme
   that Windows uses at the hardware level can lead to undesirable
   behavior when it's faster or slower than the program's natural
   processing speed for the keys.  PinballY tries to be more
   responsive by synchronizing CommandButton
   repeat events to its on-screen animation timing.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, these differences shouldn't matter to
   Javascript code, because you'll just handle one or the other
   type of event depending on the effect you're
   trying to achieve.  The differences would only matter if
   you were trying for some reason to correlate raw key events
   with the CommandButton events they lead to.  If you're doing
   that, you just need to be sure not to assume that the events
   are perfectly correlated: that is, don't write code that depends
   upon one CommandButton event being generated for every raw key
   event.
</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the original key press happened
   while the program was in the background.

   <li><b>command:</b> a string with the name of the command assigned
   to the key in the user's option settings.  This is one of the following:
   
   <ul>
      <li>"Coin1" = the first coin chute switch (usually the leftmost chute),
      sometimes wired to a "Coin In" button on the front panel

      <li>"Coin2" = the second coin chute switch (usually the middle chute,
      not typically present on a two-chute US coin door)

      <li>"Coin3" = the third coin chute switch (usually the right chute)
      
      <li>"Coin4" = the fourth coin chute switch (on a US coin door, typically
      wired to the dollar bill acceptor)

      <li>"CoinDoor" = the Coin Door button (usually assigned to the coin
      door switch in a pin cab, which either sends a keystroke each time
      the door switches between closed and open, or is held down while
      the door is open, depending on how the cabinet is wired)

      <li>"Exit" = the Exit button, which cancels the current menu,
      closes popups, etc; usually assigned to the Exit button on a pin cab
      
      <li>"ExitGame" = the Exit Game button, which terminates a running game;
      usually assigned to the Exit button on a pin cab

      <li>"FrameCounter" = toggles the on-screen frame counter on or off
      in the active window

      <li>"FullScreen" = toggles between full-screen and windowed mode in
      the active window

      <li>"Information" = shows the game information popup (the same display
      activated with the "Information" command in the main menu)

      <li>"Instructions" = shows the instruction card for the current game
      as a popup overlay
      
      <li>"Launch" = launch the current game without displaying the menu;
      usually assigned to the Launch Ball button on a pin cab
      
      <li>"Next" = the Next button, which switches to the next game,
      selects the next menu item, etc; usually assigned to the right
      flipper button on a pin cab

      <li>"NextPage" = the Next Page button, which advances to the next
      letter of the alphabet in the game wheel, advances to the next page
      of menu items, etc; usually assigned to the right MagnaSave button
      on a pin cab
      
      <li>"PauseGame" = brings PinballY to the foreground if it's currently
      in the background.  When a game is running, this usually has the
      effect of pausing the game by deactivating its window.

      <li>"Prev" = the Previous button, which switches to the prior
      game, selects the previous menu item, etc; usually assigned to the
      left flipper button on a pin cab
      
      <li>"PrevPage" = the Previous Page button, which switches to the
      previous letter of the alphabet in the game wheel, scrolls up a page
      of menu items, etc; usually assigned to the left MagnaSave button
      on a pin cab

      <li>"RotateMonitor" = rotates the active window's interior graphics
      clockwise by 90&deg;

      <li>"Select" = the Select button, which brings up the menu,
      selects the current menu item, etc; usually assigned to the Start
      button on a pin cab

      <li>"Service1" = the first service panel button, usually assigned
      to the "Escape/Cancel" button on the operator controls inside the
      coin door on a cabinet
      
      <li>"Service2" = the second service panel button, usually "-/Previous"
      on the operator controls

      <li>"Service3" = the third service panel button, usually "+/Next" on
      the operator controls
      
      <li>"Service4" = the fourth service panel button, usually "Enter/Select"
      on the operator controls
      
      <li>"Settings" = shows the Options dialog

   </ul>

   <li><b>repeat:</b> true if the key is an auto-repeat event while
   the key is being held down.
</ul>
