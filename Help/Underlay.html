<h1>Underlay</h1>

<p>
   The "underlay" is an image layer displayed at the bottom of
   the screen, in the area where the "wheel" icons appear.  Its
   only purpose is to serve as an extra decoration, and give you
   another way to customize the program's appearance.
</p>

<h2>How PinballY finds the underlay file</h2>

<p>
   Whenever you select a game in the wheel UI, PinballY loos for 
   a suitable underlay specific to the game.
</p>
<p>
   First, PinballY tries to find a custom underlay for the game's
   system (e.g., Visual Pinball X).  If the game hasn't been configured
   yet, and its system is ambiguous, we skip this step.  Assuming
   that the game has an associated system, PinballY looks for an
   image file named according to the system's <b>media directory name</b>,
   as defined in the settings, using the standard set of extensions
   for acceptable image file formats (.png, .jpg, etc).  Note,
   though, that you should really only use PNG files for underlays,
   since it's the only format that supports transparency properly.
   It then looks for this file in the following folder path:
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\System Underlays
</div>
<p>
   For example, if your Visual Pinball X system's media folder is
   set to "Visual Pinball X", the program looks for this file:
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\System Underlays\Visual Pinball X.png
</div>
<p>
   If there's no such file, the system looks for a default media
   file called <b>underlay.png</b>, searching in the usual places
   for default images (see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>):
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\Images\underlay.png<br>
   &lt;PinballY&gt;\Assets\Images\underlay.png
</div>

<p>
   After determining which underlay file to use for the newly selected
   game, PinballY checks to see if this is the same underlay file already
   being displayed.  If so, nothing happens.  If the file is different,
   PinballY switches the underlay to the new file.
</p>

<h2>How to customize the underlay files</h2>
<p>
   To provide your own custom underlay, create a transparent PNG
   file, and place it as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For a system-specific underlay, call it <b>&lt;System media folder name&gt;.png</b>,
   and place it in <b>&lt;Main media folder&gt;\System Underlays</b>

   <li>For the default underlay, call it <b>underlay.png</b> and place
   it in <b>&lt;Main media folder&gt;\Images</b>
</ul>


<h2>How the underlay is displayed</h2>
<p>
   Here's an example of an underlay file.  This is a PNG file saved
   with a transparent background, so that it can superimposed over the
   playfield image or video background layer; the light checkerboard
   pattern shows transparent areas.  Note that you can use the "alpha"
   channel in a PNG image for partial transparency as well.
</p>
<img src="underlay-example.png" class="example">
<p>
   Here's how the underlay image above looks on the screen, when
   superimposed over the playfield background.
<img src="underlay-example-on-screen.png" class="example">
<p>
   Note how the original image has been stretched out to different
   proportions when displayed as the underlay.  The display proportions
   are determined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, the image's height is scaled to a percentage of the
   window's height, according to the <b>Underlay Height</b> setting
   in the options.

   <li>Second, the image's width is scaled so that it matches the
   window's width.  However, if this exceeds the <b>Maximum Width</b>
   setting in the options, the maximum width is used.
   <p>
      The Maximum Width  setting is expressed as a <b>percentage of the window height</b>.
      That might seem a strange given that we're applying it to the
      image width.  But if you think about it, expressing a maximum image width in
      terms of the window width would be almost useless, since it would only
      let you stretch the image to a fixed portion of the width - which is
      what we're already doing by default when we stretch it to the full
      window width.  What the maximum is really for is situations where the
      window is wider than it is tall.  In those cases, we want to limit
      the horizontal stretch, so that the image isn't stretched out to
      ridiculously skinny proportions.  In other words, we want to limit
      the width-to-height aspect ratio.  That's why the limit has to be
      expressed as a percentage of the height - it's the <i>width</i>
      portion of the <i>width-to-height</i> ratio.
   </p>

   <li>Finally, the image is positioned at the bottom of the screen,
   then moved upwards by the <b>Distance from the bottom of the window</b>
   setting in the options.  The default setting is 0%, meaning that the
   image is positioned at the very bottom of the window.
</ul>
<p>
   You can adjust all of these option settings in the <a href="GameWheelOptions.html">Game Wheel</a>
   section of the settings dialog.
</p>

<h2>Javascript access</h2>
<p>
   PinballY fires the Javascript <a href="UnderlayEvent.html"><b>underlaychange</b></a> event
   whenever it's about to change the underlay.  This lets scripting code
   intervene, by canceling the change entirely or by substituting a
   different image file.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript can initiate an underlay change on
   its own at any time, via the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object method <a href="MainWindowObject.html#setUnderlay">setUnderlay()</a>.
   This gives you the ability to change the whole underlay selection scheme,
   if you don't like the default scheme where the underlay is selected purely
   on the basis of the selected game's system.
