<h1>HANDLE Objects</h1>

<p>
   The HANDLE class represents a Windows API handle.  In Windows, handles
   are unique identifiers for program resources.  Windows uses handles
   for most objects managed by the system, from user interface objects
   like windows and dialogs to kernel resources like files, processes,
   and threads.  The HANDLE type is so ubiquitous in the Windows API
   that PinballY's Javascript provides this special type to represent it.
   This is primarily for use with the <a href="DllImport.html">DLL Import</a>
   system.
</p>
<p>
   In native code, handle values are essentially pointers,
   but they don't actually "point" to anything that application code can
   access.  To an application, a handle is just an opaque identifier
   that it receives from a Windows API function that creates or access a
   resource, and passes to other API functions that operate on the
   resource.
</p>
<p>
   <a href="HWNDObject.html">HWND</a> is a sub-type used for window
   handles.  HWND has some additional methods specific to UI windows.
</p>
   

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   You don't typically create HANDLE objects directly.  You usually get
   them from external DLL functions that create or
   access system resources.  When a DLL function is declared as returning
   any sort of Windows handle type, the Javascript HANDLE class is used
   to represent the value returned to your scripting code.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases, though, you might need to convert a handle value from
   a string or numeric value.  Some types of handles (such as Window
   handles) can be meaningfully exchanged between processes, so handle
   values are sometimes converted to a numeric representation and
   sent to another process in program arguments, via shared memory,
   via a pipe, etc.  If you have a situation where you receive a handle
   in some kind of external format, you can create a HANDLE object it
   using <b>new HANDLE(<i>value</i>)</b>, where <i>value</i> can be
   a string, number, or <a href="Int64.html">Uint64</a> value containing
   a numeric representation of a handle.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   <b>toNumber():</b>  Returns a Javascript number representing the handle.
   This is the native pointer value of the handle in numeric format.
</p>
<p>
   On 64-bit Windows systems, handles are 64-bit quantities, so they can
   in principle exceed the capacity of the Javascript number type.  toNumber()
   throws an error if the handle value can't be stored.  As a result, it's
   usually safer to use toString() or toUint64() if you want to use the
   value for some data exchange purpose.
</p>

<p>
   <b>toString():</b> Returns a string representation of the handle.  The
   string is the native pointer value of the handle as a hexadecimal number.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, there's no need for this, as a handle value is usually
   only meaningful within the process that created it, and is valid only
   as long as the process is running; hence there's rarely a need to do
   anything with a handle value that requires an external representation
   like this, such as exchanging the handle with another program or
   storing it in a file.  However, some types of handles (e.g., window
   handles) are system-wide, so it's occasionally useful to create a
   representation like this that can be exchanged with another process.
</p>

<p>
   <b>toUint64():</b> Returns a <a href="Int64.html">Uint64</a> object
   representing the handle.  This is the native pointer value of the handle
   converted to a 64-bit integer, which is sufficient to hold a handle
   value on any Windows system.
