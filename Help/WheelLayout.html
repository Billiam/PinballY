<h1>Customizing the Wheel Layout</h1>

<p>
   You can change the geometry of the "game wheel" layout in the main
   window by changing some variables in the settings file (Settings.txt).
</p>
<p>
   The game wheel settings work in terms of the coordinate system that
   the Windows Direct3D graphics system uses, which is a little different
   from what you're probably to if you've done any "normal" 2D computer
   graphics.  You're probably used to thinking of the computer screen
   in terms of pixels.  D3D doesn't use pixels.  It uses an abstract
   coordinate system that's more like what you probably used in your
   high school algebra class.  In the D3D system, the whole window is
   exactly 1 unit tall and 1 unit wide, and its exact center is at
   the (x,y) coordinate (0,0).  These coordinates increase to the
   right and in the upwards direction.  Think of it as an algebraic
   graph positioned with the origin (coordinates 0,0) at the very center
   of the screen:

<p>
   Apart from the abstract units, pay close attention to the way the
   Y (vertical) axis is reversed from the normal 2D pixel coordinate
   system.  Pixel coordinates usually start at 0 at the top row, and
   increase in the <i>down</i> direction, so that the bottom of a
   1000-pixel-tall window is at row 999.  In contrast, the Y coordinates
   in the D3D system increase in the <i>upwards</i> direction.  The
   X coordinates still increase to the right, which is the same as
   the 2D convention, but of course they start at a negative value
   (-0.5) at the left side of the screen rather than starting at zero.
</p>

<p>
   With that coordinate system in mind, here are the Settings.txt
   parameters that control the wheel layout.  Note that, as with all
   Settings.txt parameters, capitalization is important - you have
   to enter the names <b>exactly</b> as shown, using the exact same
   upper- and lower-case letters.
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>Wheel.YCenter:</b>  The vertical position (in the D3D coordinate
   system described above) of the <b>center of the circle</b> that defines
   the wheel. The default is -0.803645833,  which is below the bottom of
   the window by about half the window's height; this positions the visible
   portion of the wheel in the bottom third of the window.
    
   <li><b>Wheel.XCenter:</b>  The horizontal position (in the D3D coordinate
   system described above) of the <b>center of the circle</b> that defines
   the wheel. The default is 0.0, which is centered in the window.

   <li><b>Wheel.Radius:</b>  The radius of the wheel's overall circle, in
   terms of the height of the window.  A radius of 1.0 makes the wheel's
   radius the same as the window's height.  The default is 0.476041667,
   which makes the visible portion of the wheel appear as an arc.

   <li><b>Wheel.Angle:</b>  The angle between game icons on the wheel,
   in <b>radians</b>.  The default is 0.25 (about 15&deg;).
   <p>Note that
   the game wheel always shows five icons, no matter how large or small
   the angle is: the current selection at the center, two icons
   to the left, and two icons to the right.  Even if you make the
   angle small enough to fit more icons into view, PinballY will still
   only display two on each side, so it's best to keep the angle in
   a range where you'd only see those five anyway.  It might look
   odd if you leave too much empty space at the sides.</p>

   <li><b>Wheel.OffsetAngle:</b> The angular position of the currently
    selected game in <b>radians</b>.

   <li><b>Wheel.ImageWidth:</b>  The width of the wheel icon for the
   center (selected) game, in D3D horizontal units.  The icons are
   scaled to this width, maintaining the original aspect ratio of
   the native image.  The default is 0.14.

   <li><b>Wheel.YSelected:</b>  The vertical location (in D3D coordinates)
   for the current selected game's icon.  The icon is centered on this
   position vertically.
   This variable lets you move the current game's icon away from the
   wheel arc, to give it a more prominent placement closer to the center
   of the screen.  The default is -0.07135, which is slightly below the
   vertical center of the window.

   <li><b>Wheel.XSelected:</b>  The horizontal location (in D3D coordinates)
   for the current selected game's icon.  The icon is centered on this
   position horizontally.
   This variable lets you move the current game's icon away from the
   wheel arc, to give it a more prominent placement closer to the center
   of the screen.  The default is 0, which is horizontally centered
   on the window.

</ul>
