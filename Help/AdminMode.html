<h1>Administrator Mode</h1>

<p>
   If you look at the PinballY program folder, you'll see a separate
   program called <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b>.  What is that?  Do
   you need it?  Should you be using it instead of the regular
   <b>PinballY.exe</b>?  How is this different from running
   PinballY.exe with the "Run as Administrator" command?  This
   section attempts to answer those questions.
</p>

<h2>Dos and Don'ts</h2>

<img src="DoNotRunAsAdmin.png" style="float: right;">
<ul>
   <li>DO use the regular PinballY.exe unless you have a well-defined need for Admin mode operation

   <li>ONLY use PinballY Admin Mode.exe if you really need PinballY to launch some game programs
   or Run Before/After commands in Admin mode

   <li>If you use PinballY Admin Mode.exe to launch, it will run PinballY.exe automatically,
   so DON'T launch both programs separately at the same time; use one or the other only

   <li><b>DON'T</b> use the Windows Explorer "Run as Administrator" menu command to launch PinballY.exe

   <li><b>DON'T</b> set the "Run as Administrator" checkbox in PinballY.exe's file properties

   <li><b>DON'T</b> disable UAC (User Account Control).  That doesn't just remove the
   warning prompts.  It also changes some low-level Windows functions that can affect
   application behavior.
</ul>

<h2>What is PinballY Admin Mode.exe?</h2>

<p>
   <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> is a separate PinballY component that
   you can use if you require Admin mode to run any of the games that
   PinballY launches.  If you require Admin mode, launch PinballY
   via the <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> program file <i>instead of</i> the
   normal <b>PinballY.exe</b> program.
</p>
<p>
   It might sound from the name like <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b>
   simply runs PinballY in Admin mode.  Not quite.
   What <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> actually does is a bit more
   complex:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> itself is a small program that
   runs in administrator mode
   
   <li>That program launches <b>PinballY.exe</b> in <i>regular user mode</i>

   <li>It also then remains in memory as a separate program, running in Admin mode

</ul>

<img src="AdminModeFig1.png" class="example">

<p>
   It's important to understand that PinballY Admin Mode.exe isn't just
   "PinballY running in Admin Mode".  PinballY Admin Mode.exe is actually
   a separate, small program that only performs a few special functions
   that require Administrator mode privileges.  When this is running, the
   regular PinballY.exe program - which contains the
   PinballY user interface and most of its other functions -
   runs in regular user mode.  When the user-mode PinballY program needs
   to carry out some special operation that requires Administrator
   privileges, such as launching a game in Admin mode, it sends a
   request to the Admin Mode program via the communications channel
   telling the Admin Mode program to carry out the special operation.
</p>
<p>
   This separation of the program's functions into "regular" and "Admin"
   portions is designed to allow PinballY to access privileged Admin
   functions when necessary, without forcing you to run the entire
   PinballY program in Admin mode.  And by the same token, it allows
   PinballY to launch most of your games and Run Before/After commands
   in regular user mode.  Admin mode exposes your system to more
   potential harm from program bugs, so it's best to use Admin mode
   as sparingly as possible.  
</p>


<h2>Should I use the Admin mode version?</h2>

<p>
   Not unless it's truly necessary.  It's only necessary if one of the games
   you want to launch with PinballY needs to run in Admin mode, or one of the
   Run Before/After commands needs to run in Admin mode.
</p>
<p>
   Ideally, this should never happen.  Ideally you shouldn't
   even have to read this section.  If you come across something that seems
   to require Admin mode, or that someone else told you requires Admin
   mode, that might be due to a misunderstanding or a configuration
   problem, not an actual need for Admin mode.  
   Try to find a better option before resorting to Admin mode.

</p>

<h2>It's necessary; how do I use it?</h2>

<p>
   Easy: just run <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> <i>instead of</i> the
   normal <b>PinballY.exe</b>.
</p>
<p>
   When you run PinballY Admin Mode.exe, it automatically launches
   the regular PinballY.exe for you.  You don't have to launch the
   regular PinballY.exe separately.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Don't</b> right-click PinballY.exe and select Run as Adminstrator
   from the menu.
<p>
   <b>Don't</b> check-mark the "Run as Administrator" option in the
   PinballY.exe file properties dialog.  That will prevent PinballY
   Admin Mode.exe from being able to launch the regular PinballY.exe
   in normal user mode, which defeats the purpose of the
   "separation of powers" designed into this.
</p>

<h2>How is this different from just running PinballY.exe in Admin mode?</h2>

<p>
   See the diagram above.  When you use PinballY Admin Mode.exe,
   only a small portion of the program - just the functions that
   absolutely require Admin mode privileges - actually run in
   Admin mode.  The whole rest of the program runs in ordinary
   user mode, with all of the standard Windows protections against
   accidental system damage from program bugs.  All of the game
   programs that PinballY launches also run in ordinary user mode,
   also with protection against system damage from program bugs.
</p>
<p>
   In contrast, when you use the "Run as Administrator" command
   in Windows Explorer to run PinballY.exe, you force the entire
   program <i>and every program it launches</i> to run in Admin
   mode.  The entire PinballY Direct3D UI will run in Admin
   mode.  Every Visual Pinball game it launches will run in
   Admin Mode.  Every Future Pinball game, Pinball Arcade
   Game, FX2/FX3 game, etc will run in Admin mode.  The risk of
   system instability or operating system corruption is increased.
</p>

<h2>Can't I just right-click and select Run as Administrator?</h2>

<p>
   No!  Please re-read the section above for why this doesn't work.
</p>


<h2>What is Admin mode anyway?</h2>

<p>
   Admin mode is a special Windows security mode that gives a program
   full, unrestricted access to nearly all Windows system resources, such
   as operating system files, OS registry keys, and protected memory areas.
   Windows blocks ordinary "user mode" programs from accessing these
   resources, to protect the system against harm by malware and by
   accidental program bugs.
</p>
<p>
   Microsoft designed Admin mode for use by trusted system programs
   only, such as Windows control panels, special system setup programs,
   installers, and the like.  In Microsoft's view, nearly all programs
   should run in ordinary user mode.  Admin mode is intended to be a rare
   exception that you use only when you're doing something special that
   has a legitimate need to mess with system settings.  However,
   Microsoft left it up to the user to decide which programs
   get the special privileges.  If you really want to run some Elbonian
   ransomware in Admin mode, Windows will let you.
</p>

<h2>Why you should avoid Admin mode when possible</h2>

<p>
   Admin mode is dangerous because a program running in Admin mode
   has unrestricted access to all system resources.  It can make changes
   to system files, including core operating system files and registry
   entries.  In the worst case, such changes can damage the system and
   force you to reinstall Windows.
</p>

<h2>I don't have to worry, I never download malware!</h2>
<p>
   Most people think of the Windows security restrictions as being
   all about malware, so they think they don't have to worry about
   "regular" software.  Malware is certainly an important factor.
   But Microsoft created
   the system protections as much to prevent <i>accidental</i>
   damage as to prevent malware attacks.  Back in the early days of
   Windows, the OS had a bad reputation for crashing a lot.
   Some of that reputation was deserved,
   but a lot of the mess actually came from buggy third-party
   application software that could trash the system accidentally,
   just because the system was so wide-open.  Microsoft put 
   the Admin mode barriers in place in large part to prevent
   application program bugs from crashing the whole system.
   A lot of the stability improvements of modern Windows versions
   come from the protections that prevent the Windows core from
   being damaged by application bugs.
</p>
<p>
   When you run a program in Admin mode, you take down all of those
   barriers. When you turn off UAC and/or run everything in Admin
   mode, you increase the chances that one bad application
   program can trash your whole system.
