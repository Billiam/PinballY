<h1>Javascript Scripting</h1>

<p>
   PinballY includes a full Javascript engine for user scripting customizations.
   This is a new feature in the Beta 2 release and is still very preliminary
   and experimental, so be aware of two big caveats:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>It's not very fleshed out yet
   <li>Many details are likely to change as it matures
</ul>

<p>
   This feature is preliminary and experimental, but the underlying
   Javascript engine isn't.  The Javascript system is ChakraCore, Microsoft's
   modern, ES6-compliant engine that provides Javascript execution for their Edge
   browser.  "Microsoft Javascript" might sound like something cruddy if you didn't
   know better, but this isn't the slow, idiosyncratic Javascript from old Internet Explorer
   browsers.  This is a whole new system they built from the ground up for Edge.
   You can expect full support for modern
   language standards, and excellent performance that rivals native compiled code.
</p>

<h2>Core Javascript vs browser Javascript</h2>

<p>
   It's important to understand that Javascript isn't the same as a Web
   browser.  Javascript is a complete programming language that can stand
   on its own.  It's most often used
   as part of a Web browser, so a lot of people think that Javascript
   is all tangled up with HTML and browser events and so on, and that
   those are inseparably part of the language.  They're not.  Javascript
   itself doesn't know anything about "document" or "window" or
   "navigator" or HTML events.  Those things all come from the browser.
   Within a Web browser environment, you can access those Web objects
   through Javascript, but they're not part of Javascript.  You won't
   find them in the PinballY version of Javascript.   Instead, you'll
   find a separate set of UI objects and functions that match the
   PinballY environment.
</p>
<p>
   The PinballY version of Javascript does include everything that's
   built in to the language.  To find out more about what's actually
   part of Javascript vs what comes from the Web browser environment,
   find a good Javascript language reference and read about the
   standard set of built-in objects and functions.  There's a lot of
   good Javascript documentation available on the Web, so I won't
   try to provide my own (inevitably inferior) reference guide
   here.  One good place to look is the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a>,
   which has extensive and up-to-date Javscript documentation:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript documentation on MDN</a>
</div>

<p>
   But note that MDN covers the whole gamut of Web technologies, not just
   Javascript, so do pay attention to which technology they're covering
   when you're exploring topics there.  Only the core Javascript language
   documentation is relevant to PinballY's scripting features.
</p>

<h2>How to enable scripting</h2>

<p>
   Scripting is automatically enabled.  To use it, create a script file
   called <b>main.js</b>, and put it in the <b>Scripts</b>
   folder within your main PinballY program folder.  At startup, PinballY
   will look to see if this file exists, and if so, PinballY will
   automatically load and run the file.
</p>
<p>
   What goes in this file?  Generally speaking, it can contain any valid
   Javascript code.  More specifically, it will usually consist of a
   set of event handler functions for one or more of the program events that
   PinballY defines, and some startup code that installs the handlers as
   "event listeners", so that PinballY knows to call your handler functions
   when the program events that you want to handle occur.
</p>

<h2>How to use multiple script files</h2>

<p>
   By default, PinballY only loads one file, Scripts\main.js.  But that
   doesn't mean that you have to cram all of your scripting code into that
   one place.  You can use the standard Javascript ES6 <b>import</b>
   command to load additional modules.  This lets you mix and match
   feature modules created by other users, and lets you create your
   own individual feature modules to share.</p>
<p>
   Import is specifically
   designed to make it easy to combine code written by different people,
   by letting you say exactly which symbols (and only those) are shared
   among modules.  That avoids all sorts of problems that <i>usually</i>
   come up when people try to share code, such as when two people
   both used the same names for their variables and functions.
</p>
<p>
   The basic Javascript import syntax looks like this:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   import { <i>function-or-object-name</i> } from "<i>module.js</i>";
</div>
<p>
   You can import multiple symbols from the module by listing them
   inside the braces, separated by commas.
</p>
<p>
   There's a lot more to the "import" syntax than this, including a
   dynamic form (the import() function) that lets you import code
   conditionally or at specific points in time.  
</p>


<h2>Event handlers</h2>

[TO DO]

<h2>Browser-like functions</h2>

<p>
   As mentioned above, many of the functions and objects in a Web browser
   Javascript environment aren't part of the Javascript standard.  PinballY
   provides equivalents for some of the most often used functions, with
   the same names, interfaces, and semantics (or as similar as is practical).
   PinballY also provides some extensions with similar functionality, but
   tailored more to the PinballY environment.
</p>

<p>
   <b>alert(<i>message</i>):</b>  Shows a system dialog box with the given
   message text.  This pops up a standard modal Windows message box with an OK
   button, and pauses the script until the user dismisses the dialog.  This
   can be handy for script debugging, but it should be avoided for anything
   else, as it doesn't fit very well with PinballY's pin cab interaction
   style.  See message() for a friendlier alternative, and log() for another
   debugging option.
</p>
<p>
   <b>clearInterval(<i>id</i>)</b>:  Cancels an interval event created
   with setInterval().  The <i>id</i> value is the value returned from
   setInterval() when the event was created.  This removes the event and
   prevents any pending execution from occurring.  It's harmless to
   cancel an interval that doesn't exist or has already been canceled.
</p>
<p>
   <b>clearTimeout(<i>id</i>)</b>:  Cancels a pending timeout event
   created with setTimeout().  The <i>id</i> value is the value returned
   from setTimeout() when the event was created.  This removes the event
   and prevents any pending execution from occurring.  It's harmless
   to cancel a timeout that doesn't exist or has already been canceled.
   This will also have no effect if the timeout has already been executed,
   since you can't "take back" the previous execution.
</p>
<p>
   <b>log(<i>message</i>):</b> Writes the message text to the PinballY log file.
   A newline (line break) is always added at the end of the message, so it's
   not necessary to include one in the string.  This can be useful for
   debugging, especially for cases where you want to log some information
   repeatedly and don't want to bother the user with it every time.
   (This is a PinballY extension, not a typical browser function.)
</p>
<p>
   <b>message(<i>message</i>, <i>style</i>):</b>  Shows a message using a
   graphical popup box in the main PinballY playfield window.  Unlike alert(),
   this doesn't pause the script until the user acknowledges the message;
   this simply shows or queues the message and returns immediately.  This
   is a good option for showing error messages or status updates, since it
   doesn't interrupt the flow of the user interface with a modal dialog.
   If <i>style</i> is provided, it's a string value specifying the
   visual style of the popup message.  This can be "info", "warning", or
   "error", which show the message with green, orange, and red trim
   (respectively), to visually reinforce the nature of the message.  The
   regular "info" style is used if <i>style</i> is omitted.
   (This is a PinballY extension, not a typical browser function.)
</p>
<p>
   <b>setInterval(<i>function</i>, <i>interval_in_milliseconds</i>)</b>:  Sets
   up an interval event, which invokes the given function periodically, at
   (approximately) the specified interval.  Each the time function is invoked,
   the internal event timer is automatically reset so that the event will
   be called again after another interval of the same time elapses.  The
   function returns an ID value that can be used to cancel the repeating
   event via clearInterval().  Like Javascript in a browser, PinballY's
   Javascript is single-threaded, so an interval event can't "interrupt" an
   executing script; if the next scheduled event time happens to occur
   while another script is executing, the interval function will be invoked
   when the current script finishes.
</p>
<p>
   <b>setTimeout(<i>function</i>, <i>timeout_in_milliseconds</i>)</b>:  Sets
   up a timeout event, which invokes the given function once, after the given
   interval elapses.  The function returns an ID value that can be used to
   cancel the timeout before it executes via clearTimeout().  As with
   Javascript in a browser, PinballY's Javascript is single-threaded, so
   timer events can't "interrupt" other scripts.  If the timeout period
   elapses while another script is running, the function will be invoked
   when the current script finishes.
