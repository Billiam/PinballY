<h1>Javascript Scripting</h1>

<p>
   PinballY includes a full Javascript engine for user scripting customizations.
   This is a new feature in the v1.0.0 Beta 2 release.  It's preliminary
   and experimental, so be aware of some caveats:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>It's not fully fleshed out yet
   <li>It hasn't been field-tested
   <li>Many details may change
</ul>

<p>
   "Not fully fleshed out yet" means that I've only started adding Javascript
   event hooks and system functions. If there's something you'd like to
   customize, and you can't find a way to do it, it's probably not because
   I considered it and ruled it out; it probably just didn't occur to me.
   Send me your ideas.
</p>

<p>
   The idea of Javascript support in PinballY is preliminary and experimental, but the
   underlying Javascript engine isn't.  Javascript is implemented via ChakraCore,
   Microsoft's high-performance, standards-compliant Javascript engine.  Microsoft
   built ChakraCore for the Edge  browser and released it as open source.  It has
   top-tier performance and implements modern Javascript standards.  You can use all
   of the cool new ES6 language features,
   like "let", "class", "for..of", destructuring assignments, "arrow" (=&gt;)
   functions, template literals, promises, the spread operator, and typed arrays.
</p>


<h2>Is this like Web browser Javascript?</h2>

<p>
   Yes and no.  PinballY's Javascript <i>language</i> is exactly
   the same as the Javascript language in a modern Web browser.
</p>
<p>
   But the programming environment isn't quite the same as in a Web browser.
   Many of the objects and functions you use when programming a Web page are
   part of the browser, not part of Javascript itself.  For example, the
   "document" and "window" objects, the HTML DOM tree, and events like
   "onclick" and "onchar" all come from the browser, not from Javascript.
   PinballY doesn't have those browser elements because it's not a browser.
   Instead, PinballY provides its own, somewhat different set of objects
   that represent the PinballY user interface environment.  With that in
   mind, there's still a lot that's similar, because we've tried to maintain
   familiar names and familiar behaviors wherever there's good overlap
   in functionality.  For example, PinballY's
   event model is very much like a browser's, and a number of common
   browser-like functions are available, such as timeouts and intervals.
</p>

<h2>How to enable scripting</h2>

<p>
   Scripting is automatically enabled.  To use it, create a script file
   called <b>main.js</b>, and put it in the <b>Scripts</b>
   folder within your main PinballY program folder.  At startup, PinballY
   looks to see if this file exists, and if it does, the system
   automatically loads and runs the file.  (If there's no main.js,
   it's perfectly fine; no error message will pop up.
   Javascript will simply be disabled for the session.)
</p>
<p>
   What goes in main.js?  Well, pretty much anything that's valid
   Javascript code.  But practically speaking, what you'll usually do here
   is set up some "event listeners" for PinballY's program events.  Event
   listeners are functions that you write in Javascript for PinballY
   to call when particular events happen in the user interface.  If
   you've ever done any Web browser Javascript programming, you'll
   recognize that as the same basic approach that you'd use there.
   The only difference is that you're working with PinballY's event
   scheme in this case rather than with Web browser events.
</p>
<p>
   If you wish, you can organize your code into multiple files. This
   might be especially interesting if you want to share your code
   or use modules written by other people.  See <a href="#multipleFiles">How to
   use multiple script files</a> later in this section.

<h2>Overall program flow</h2>

<p>
   When PinballY starts up, it loads the <b>main.js</b> file that
   you provide.  Javascript immediately executes all of the code in
   the file that's defined outside of any function or class
   definitions.  
   If you're familiar with more traditional programming languages
   like C or C++, this "outer" code in a Javascript file is the
   equivalent of the "main" routine that's executed at program startup
   in a traditional language.
</p>
<p>
   The main thing that the top-level code in your main.js file
   will usually do is set up <i>event listeners</i>.  An event
   listener is a function you write that will be called when a
   specific event occurs.  Once the event listener is set up,
   PinballY will call it whenever the associated event occurs.
</p>

<h2>Avoid long-running operations</h2>

<p>
   You should avoid any operations in Javascript that will take a long
   time to complete, especially things like timing loops or waiting
   for external calls (such as network reads) to complete.  Javascript
   runs as part of the main user interface thread, so operations that
   involve long waits are a no-no.  Long waits in Javascript can make the UI
   windows appear to be frozen.
</p>
<p>
   Any timed waits should be done via a timeout or interval.  Waits
   for external events should be handled with asynchronous mechanisms,
   ideally through Javascript Promise objects.  In the unlikely event
   that you have a time-consume computational task to perform, it's
   best to break it up into small time slices using intervals.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
   Most of the code you write for PinballY will be there to handle
   events.  An event is something like "the user pressed a key"
   or "a game is being launched".
</p>
<p>
   A function you write to handle an event is called an
   <i>event listener</i>.  PinballY notifies you that
   something is happening by calling your event listeners for
   that particular event.
</p>
<p>
   If you've used Visual Basic or C#, you might expect that
   event handlers are set up by using a special function name
   when you define an event handler function.  That's not how it works
   in Javascript.   Instead, you set up each handler explicitly,
   so you can use any name for any handler function.
</p>
<p>
   You set up an event listener by calling a function to add
   the listener to the <i>event target</i> object that generates
   the events of interest.  An event target represents a PinballY
   user interface element that's associated with one or more
   events.  The primary event target for most events is the
   <b>mainWindow</b> object, which represents the main playfield
   window.  Most UI events are handled in this window, even
   when other windows (such as the backglass or DMD) are open.
</p>
<p>
   To attach an event listener to an event target, you use the
   <b>on()</b> method of the event target object:
</p>

<div class="code">
// This is an event listener function for "key down" events.  The
// name doesn't matter, because we're going to call on() in a moment
// to register the listener.  (This isn't like Visual Basic, where events
// are tied to special function names.)

function myListener(event)
{
   // do something with the key-down event
}

// &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's where we register our listener! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 
mainWindow.on("keydown", myListener);

// Event listeners don't even have to be named at all.  You can use
// anonymous functions, like this:
mainWindow.on("keydown", function(ev) { /* do something with the event */ });

// You can also use the even more succinct "arrow" function notation
mainWindow.on("keydown", (ev) => { /* handler */ });
</div>

<p>
   You can also specify more than one event at a time, by separating
   the event names with spaces:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown keyup", (ev) => { /* this is called for both keydown and keyup events! */ });
</div>

<p>
   <b>on()</b> <i>adds</i> a listener.  It doesn't replace or
   remove existing listeners for the same event.  If there's already another
   event listener on the same object, the old listener and the new
   listener will both be called when the event occurs.  You can add any
   number of listeners this way.  This is especially useful if you're
   mixing packages written by different people, because it helps ensure
   that listeners from different packages can co-exist peacefully.
</p>
<p>
   There's variation of <b>on()</b> called <b>one()</b>, which
   adds a listener that only runs a single time.  The first time it's
   called, it runs normally, then the system automatically removes it.
</p>

<p>
   You can remove an event listener explicitly via the <b>off</b>
   method:
</p>
<div class="code">
   mainWindow.off("keydown");
</div>
<p>
   Calling <b>off()</b> with an event name simply removes all listeners
   for the given event name.  You can also remove a specific
   listener, by passing in the same function you used to set up the
   listener in the first place with <b>on()</b>:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off("keydown", myListener);
</div>

<p>
   You can specify a "namespace" with each event created with <b>on()</b>.
   A namespace is specified after the event name, separated with a period (.).
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown.MyPlugin", (ev) => { /* handler */ });
</div>

<p>
   The point of the namespace is to identify the listener
   for later removal.  When you call <b>off()</b>, you can 
   use the same namespace qualifier to remove only the listener(s)
   created with that namespace:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off("keydown.MyPlugin");   // removes only the MyPlugin handler(s)
</div>

<p>
   Remember, the normal <b>off()</b> removes <i>all</i> listeners for the
   named event.  Using a namespace qualifier removes only the matching
   listeners.  This is especially useful for sharing code, because it
   lets you make nicely isolated code that won't interfere with other
   people's code that it's combined with.
</p>
<p>
   Using a namespace also lets you easily remove every event listener
   of every type that you installed under the namespace.  Just call <b>off()</b>
   with the namespace qualifier alone, with no event name:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off(".MyPlugin");  // removes every mainWindow event with a .MyPlugin namespace
</div>

<p>

   to the methods for adding and removing event listeners to event
   target objects like <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>.

   <li><a href="Event.html">Event</a>, for a reference to the properties
   and methods of the Event object that's passed as a parameter to each
   event listener.  The Event object describes the details of the event,
   such as which key was pressed.
</ul>

<h2>Built-in functions</h2>

<p>
   All of the standard Javascript built-in functions are implemented in
   the ChakraCore engine.  You can find documentation on those in any
   Javascript reference.  In addition, PinballY provides a number of
   its own built-in functions for access to the program environment
   and to replicate some of the basic built-in features in Web browsers,
   such as timeouts and intervals.  See <a href="SystemFunctions.html">System Functions</a>
   for details.
</p>

<h2>System objects and classes</h2>

<p>
   PinballY provides access to the program environment through a number
   of pre-defined system objects.  These are analogous to the system
   objects in a Web browser ("window", "document", etc), but are tailored
   to the PinballY environment instead of a browser environment.
   See <a href="SystemObjects.html">System Objects</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, the system provides some additional functionality
   through pre-defined system classes.  These are object classes that
   you and/or the system can instantiate to carry out operations
   beyond the normal scope of Javascript's type system.
   See <a href="SystemClasses.html">System Classes</a> for details.


<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>
   A good debugger is indispensable for any non-trivial programming
   project.  PinballY doesn't have a debugger UI built in, but it
   does have something much better instead: support for connecting
   a <i>real</i> debugger.  You can use it with Visual Studio Code,
   Microsoft's free code editor and Javascript IDE.  For details on
   setting up the debugger, see <a href="JsDebug.html">Javascript Debugging</a>.
</p>

<h2>How to use multiple script files</h2>

<p>
   By default, PinballY only loads one file, Scripts\main.js.  But that
   doesn't mean that you have to cram all of your scripting code into that
   one place.  You can use the standard Javascript ES6 <b>import</b>
   command to load additional modules.  This lets you mix and match
   feature modules created by other users, and lets you create your
   own individual feature modules to share.
</p>
<p>
   (Don't confuse the Javascript ES6 <i>import</i> command with the
   <a href="DllImport.html">DLL import</a> system.  The DLL import feature is
   a PinballY add-on, not standard Javascript.  The standard <b>import</b>
   command imports other Javascript files, whereas the DLL import
   scheme lets you access native code in external DLLs.)
</p>
<p>
   The import system is specifically
   designed to make it easy to combine code written by different people,
   by letting you say exactly which symbols (and only those) are shared
   among modules.  That avoids all sorts of problems that <i>usually</i>
   come up when people try to share code, such as when two people
   both used the same names for their variables and functions.
</p>
<p>
   The basic Javascript import syntax looks like this:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   import { <i>function-or-object-name</i> } from "<i>module.js</i>";
</div>
<p>
   You can import multiple symbols from the module by listing them
   inside the braces, separated by commas.
</p>
<p>
   There's a lot more to the "import" syntax than this, including a
   dynamic form (the import() function) that lets you import code
   conditionally or at specific points in time.  Refer to a Javascript
   language reference for full details.
</p>

<h2>Calling external DLL functions</h2>

<p>
   PinballY's Javascript has extensions that let you call
   external native code in DLLs (dynamic link libraries).
   The system is unlike most "plug-in" systems in that you
   can call most native code directly from Javascript,
   even if the native code you're calling was never written
   with PinballY in mind.  In particular, you can use the
   extensions to call most Windows APIs directly from
   Javascript, with no external C or C++ code required.
   You can also use it to add your own custom code to PinballY,
   written in any native-code language, without having to build
   PinballY from source.   You just compile your code into a DLL,
   and call your DLL from Javascript using these same extensions.
   See <a href="DllImport.html">DLL Imports</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Browser frameworks (jquery, etc)</h2>

<p>
   Web Javascript frameworks like jQuery generally <b>won't</b>
   work in PinballY.  That's because Web browser frameworks
   depend heavily on the Web browser HTML document structure and
   event model.  As we've already discussed, those don't exist in
   PinballY.  But jQuery in particular has influenced some of the
   pre-defined framework in PinballY's Javascript environment,
   so some of the concepts carry over in general terms, even if
   the exact details can't.
</p>

<h2>System script files</h2>

<p>
   Many of the classes, objects, and functions that constitute 
   PinballY's Javascript "application environment" are implemented
   in Javascript, so you can easily view the code to see what it's
   doing, in case you need any details beyond what's covered in
   this section.  You can even change the system code if you have
   some unusual situation that requires such drastic measures,
   although that's strongly discouraged, for the obvious reason that
   it will make it harder to update to a new release.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY's system scripts are in the <b>Scripts\System</b> folder
   within your PinballY program folder.  These files are automatically
   loaded when PinballY starts up (or, in some cases, later on when
   needed), so there's no need to copy any of these files into your
   own .js files or to load them explicitly with "import" or any
   other means.  You can simply expect these files to be available
   at all times.
</p>
<p>
   A quick summary of the files:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>SystemClasses.js:</b>  The main application environment
      classes, such as the <b>mainWindow</b> object and the 
      event handling classes.

   <li><b>CParser.js:</b>  Code that parses C-style function and
      struct definitions for use in the DllImport system.
</ul>

<h2>Javascript language documentation</h2>

<p>
   I won't attempt to offer a Javascript tutorial or reference manual here,
   since you can find lots of both on the Web, and better
   ones than I could write.  PinballY's Javascript is fully standard,
   so the information in any good language manual will apply here.
   One good place to look is the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a>,
   which has extensive and up-to-date Javscript documentation:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript documentation on MDN</a>
</div>
<p>
   The only thing you have to keep in mind while reading Web
   Javascript documentation is that PinballY doesn't have the
   usual complement of Web browser environment objects ("document",
   the HTML DOM tree, etc).  A lot of Javascript material is
   really more about Web development than Javascript.  You'll
   have to rework the examples from more Web-oriented material
   in your mind to see past the assumption that you're working
   in a browser.
