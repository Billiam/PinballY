<h1>Custom Windows</h1>

<p>
   This type of object represents a window that you create via
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow</a>.
   It's a specialization of the basic <a href="WindowObjects.html">Window Objects</a>
   that the system provides for the main playfield window, the backglass window,
   and so forth.  You can use custom windows to supplement the standard set
   of windows if you have additional media types that you want to display.
</p>
<p>
   For an example of how to create your own custom windows, see
   <a href="CustomMediaWindowExample.html">Custom Media Window</a> in
   the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a> section.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   A custom window has all of the standard properties and methods
   common to all windows, as described in <a href="WindowObjects.html">Window Objects</a>.
   It also has some extended functionality of its own.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="backgroundScalingMode"></a>
   <b>backgroundScalingMode:</b>  This property controls how background images
   and videos are scaled to fit the window.  You can change it by assigning one
   of the string values below, and you can determine the current mode by
   comparing it to these string values.  It has two possible settings:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"stretch": This is the default.  In stretch mode, the image or video
   is stretched in both the horizontal and vertical directions to exactly
   fill the window, without trying to preserve the original media's aspect ratio.
   This can distort the image by making it look too tall or too wide, but
   it guarantees that the window area is exactly covered.
   
   <li>"zoom": In zoom mode, the original aspect ratio of the media is
   preserved, and the image is scaled to fill either the window's full height
   or its full width, according to which one allows the full image to fit
   without any cropping.  If this leaves blank areas, they're filled with
   black, and the image is centered.  This mode avoids any geometrical
   distortion, but it can leave blank black areas if the image doesn't
   have the same aspect ratio as the window.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
   <a name="pagedImageIndex"></a>
   <b>pagedImageIndex:</b>  This property lets you scroll through "paged"
   and "indexed" image types, so that you can display different 
   images from the game's collection on command.  Reading this property
   retrieves the index of the media item currently displayed, starting at 0
   for the first item in the list.  Writing this property changes the
   display to show the item at the given index.  If the new value is past
   the last available item or less than zero, the system automatically
   "wraps" to the beginning or end of the list (respectively).
</p>
<p>
   The simplest way to use this property is to increment it to scroll
   forward to the next image, and decrement it to scroll back to
   the previous item.  Because the system automatically "wraps" the
   value into the valid range, you can simply increment and decrement
   the current value without bothering to check bounds.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this method only works with <b>image</b> types.  If a
   window can show both video and image backgrounds, changing the
   paged image index will always select an image, even if a video
   is available.
</p>
<p>
   Of the built-in types, this applies to Flyers and Instruction Cards.
   By the conventions of the HyperPin Media Packs,
   Flyers are "paged", meaning a single game can have multiple flyer
   images associated with it, arranged into subfolders of the main
   Flyers media folder, with names like "Front", "Back", "Inside1", etc.
   The Instruction Cards are "indexed", meaning that they have numeric
   suffixes attached to the filenames: "Sinbad (Gottlieb 1978) 1.png",
   "Sinbad (Gottlieb 1978) 2.png", and so on.  If you define your own
   custom media types, you can use paging and indexing for any type
   you create that has a similar need for multiple images per game.
</p>
<p>
   (I know it's inconsistent and complicating to have these two different
   conventions, "Paged" and "Indexed", for essentially the same function.
   PinballY only uses them because that's how the files are arranged in
   the widely deployed HyperPin media packs.  Since those are the most
   convenient source of front-end media, I wanted to make them easy to
   use with PinballY.  I didn't want to force everyone to undertake a
   renaming project every time they imported a media pack.)
</p>

   <a name="showMediaWhenRunningFlag"></a>
   <b>showMediaWhenRunningFlag:</b>  This property lets you control
   whether or not the window continues to show media while a game is
   running.  This is the custom window equivalent of the options
   dialog checkboxes that let you control the same behavior for the
   built-in windows.  This can take on three possible values:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>true</b> means that the window continues to show its media
   while a game is running

   <li><b>false</b> means that the window is blanked out and sent to
   the background while a game is running.  This is the default
   behavior for custom windows, and it's also the default for all
   of the system windows, except when you override it using the
   options settings (the "Keep showing this game's media while
   running" checkboxes in the Game Details box, the system setup
   options pages, and the Launch options page).

   <li><b>undefined</b> means that the normal "key" mechanism is
   used.  The system windows use the key to store the per-game,
   per-system, and global preferences set through the various
   settings dialogs, by checking the status of the key in the
   global settings file and the Game Stats file.  If you defined
   a key for this window when creating it (see <b>showMediaWhenRunningKey</b>
   undef <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow()</a>),
   the system uses the same key search for this custom window.
   If you didn't define a key string for the window when creating
   it, <b>undefined</b> has the same meaning as <b>false</b>,
   yielding the default behavior of blanking out the window while
   a game is running.
</ul>
<p>
   Note that values of <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> override any
   "key" lookup, so you can use these to control the behavior
   unconditionally in Javascript code.  For example, you could
   use a <a href="GameSelectEvent.html"><b>gameselect</b></a>
   event to decide on how to handle the window for the current
   game each time a new game is selected, setting
   <b>showMediaWhenRunningFlag</b> to the desired value.
