<h1>Media Capture Options - FFMPEG</h1>

<p>
   This settings page groups the Media Capture options related to
   FFMPEG, the video encoding program that PinballY uses for
   screen captures.  There's a separate options page,
   <a href="CaptureOptions.html">Capture Options</a>, for the
   more generic settings related to the capture process generally.
</p>

<h2>Option details</h2>

<p>
   <b>Use two-pass video encoding:</b>  Use this option if your
   captured videos look too choppy.  Normally, PinballY tries to
   capture and compress video frames at the same time, in
   a single pass.  This requires a fairly fast machine, though; on
   slower machines, the video encoder might drop frames (omit
   them from the resulting video) when it can't keep up with the
   live video rate.  Dropped frames are visible as momentary
   freezes when you play back the video, which can make the
   video look choppy or jerky.  If this happens on your machine,
   you can try two-pass encoding instead.  Two-pass encoding
   initially captures the video frames without any compression,
   which can usually be done without any dropped frames even on
   slower machines.  It then goes back and re-encodes the video
   to a compressed format after the full capture has finished.
   This takes longer overall because of the separate second pass,
   but should eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) dropped
   frames in the resulting video.
</p>
<p>
   Optimization tip:
   If you've tuned your system to give higher priority to pinball
   software via a tool like <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinAffinity.html">PinAffinity</a>,
   you should add <b>ffmpeg.exe</b> to the list of programs that
   receive priority CPU access.  Ffmpeg is the program that
   PinballY uses to carry out screen capture operations.  Screen
   capture is inherently CPU-intensive, so ffmpeg will do a better
   job of capturing if it's given full CPU resources.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Limit captured videos to HD resolution:</b>  Check this box
   to limit the resolution of captured videos to HD (1920x1080 pixels).
   By default, videos created using the media capture function have
   the same pixel size as the screen area being captured, but you
   can use this option to set an upper limit of HD resolution.
   This won't affect videos captured from smaller screen areas;
   it only sets an upper bound for the resolution.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, it's best to capture at the full original
   resolution, since that gives you the most faithful reproduction
   of the original graphics.  However, videos captured from 4K
   monitors and other large formats might be too big to play back
   smoothly on older or slower systems, or might not even play back
   at all if memory is limited.  If you have a large monitor, and your
   system can't smoothly play videos captured at full size,
   you can use this option to limit the videos to HD resolution.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Temp file folder:</b>  This lets you specify the folder path
   for temporary files created during two-pass video encoding.
   By default, the temp files are created in the same folder as
   the final video.  However, there might be a different folder
   that you'd prefer to use, depending on how your system is set up.
   In particular, if you have a disk that's especially fast or
   that has a lot of extra space, that might be a good place for
   the temp files, because the uncompressed video files created
   during the first pass of a two-pass recording are very large.
   A fast disk is advantageous because FFMPEG has to transfer
   the large, uncompressed video stream to the drive in
   real time in order to keep up with the live video without
   dropping frames.
</p>

<p>
   <b>1st pass codec opts:</b>  The video codec options for the
   first pass of a two-pass recording.  If you leave this blank,
   PinballY uses its default settings, which are currently:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <tt>-c:v libx264 -threads 8 -qp 0 -preset ultrafast</tt>
</div>
<p>
   That setting is designed to minimize FFMPEG's CPU usage during
   the initial live capture pass by doing little or no compression,
   but the lack of compression means that it creates extremely
   large files.  That can present a new bottleneck if the disk
   containing the temporary folder isn't fast enough, so it
   might actually be faster overall on some systems to use
   a preset that does slightly more compression.  This option
   lets you experiment to find the best setting for your system.
</p>

   <a name="AudioCaptureDevice"></a>
   <b>Audio capture device:</b>  This lets you select the audio
   input (recording) device to use for media capture operations
   that record audio, such as table audio tracks and table
   videos that include audio.
</p>
<p>
   The drop list shows a list of all of the audio input devices
   currently in your system.  You should choose the one that
   records from the "Line Out" port of your sound card.  This
   is often called "Stereo Mix" or something similar.

<h2>About the Audio Capture Device</h2>

<h4>Why can't PinballY choose a device automatically?</h4>
<p>
   Because Windows doesn't provide a standard device driver for
   this function, and Microsoft didn't even bother to specify
   a standard name for the driver.  You'd think that Windows
   would offer an audio capture function automatically, but it
   doesn't; Microsoft left it up to the sound card manufacturers
   to provide drivers, and left it up to them to name the
   devices.  So there's no way for PinballY to know the name
   of this driver on your system, and in fact no way to even
   know if there's one installed.
</p>
<p>
   "Stereo Mix" is a common name for this driver only because
   it's the name that Realtek uses for its loopback driver,
   and Realtek chips are ubiquitous, especially in
   the built-in audio in many motherboards these
   days.  If your system has integrated audio on the
   motherboard, chances are that it uses the Realtek chips,
   so its driver will probably be called "Stereo Mix".
   But the name might be the translated equivalent of
   "Stereo Mix" if your system is localized to a language
   other than English, or it might be something else entirely.
</p>
   

<h4>What is the "Default" device?</h4>
<p>
   "Default" isn't actually a device in its own right.  It's
   just a way of telling PinballY to select a device automatically,
   which it does by searching the list you see for an entry
   with the words "Stereo Mix" in its name.  If you don't see
   any such device in the list, PinballY won't be able to find
   one either, because it works from the same list you see here.
   So "Default" won't actually work unless you see a suitable
   device listed.  If you see a device with a similar name,
   or a version of "Stereo Mix" translated into your system's
   localization language, you should explicitly select that
   item, because PinballY won't be able to figure it out on
   its own based on the different name.
</p>

<h4>What if the audio device list <i>only</i> shows "Default"?</h4>
<p>
   If "Default" is the only device you see in the audio capture
   device drop list, you won't be able to capture audio when
   recording screen shots.  As described above, "Default" isn't
   actually a device, it's just our way of telling PinballY to
   choose a device by searching for one with "Stereo Mix"
   in its name.  If you don't see a "Stereo Mix" device in the
   list, PinballY won't be able to find one either.
</p>
<p>
   So what can you do about it if the list is empty, or if
   there aren't any suitable capture devices?  The answer is
   that you have to install a suitable device driver.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases, it's just a matter of enabling a device
   that's disabled in the Windows audio control panels.  Some
   sound cards come with Stereo Mix or equivalent devices
   and disable them by default.  To check for disabled devices,
   open the Windows sound control panel and go to the Recording
   tab.  Look for a device called Stereo Mix or something similar;
   if you find it, enable it, and try again in PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   If the Windows sound control panel doesn't list any Stereo
   Mix or equivalent devices, you'll have to find and install
   a device driver capable of recording from the Line Out port.
   This usually has to come from your
   sound card manufacturer, so check the support site for
   your sound card or your PC vendor to see if they have a
   Stereo Mix or "audio loopback" device driver you can use.
