<h1>Custom Play Modes</h1>

<p>
   Some of the popular pinball player programs have multiple ways
   of playing the same game.  For example, Future Pinball has an
   add-on that lets you use a head-tracking camera to create a
   3D effect.  Pinball FX3 has options for multi-player modes and
   different physics modes.
</p>
<p>
   For most people, it's enough to be able to set the specific
   command-line options you want when launching each type of game
   in the <a href="SystemOptions.html">system options</a>.
   If you like playing FX3 with its classic physics mode, just put
   that option in the FX3 command line setup.  But what if you want
   to play in different modes at different times?  You don't want
   to have to edit the option settings every time you launch a
   game.  For this, you want a way to say "Play in classic mode"
   or "Play in remastered mode" instead of just "Play".  In other
   words, new menu commands for the different modes.
</p>
<p>
   This is actually the original use case that motivated adding
   the Javascript engine to PinballY.  I heard from someone who
   suggested adding special options for Future Pinball's different
   modes; later on I got a request to add special modes for FX3.
   I didn't like the idea of adding special cases for these
   particular systems, since that would be so inflexible as the
   different game makers came up with new options, and as new
   games came onto the scene.  But when I tried to think of ways
   to generalize it across systems, it looked like a very complex
   problem: some games might need different executables for
   different modes, others might have changing command line
   options, others might launch with different game files.
   And the user interface options you'd need to select all of
   the different possibilities seemed equally hard to boil down.
   It seemed like what you needed to capture all of the different
   possibilities amounted to a programming language.  Rather
   than inventing a special programming language for this
   one task, it seemed better to incorporate a real language
   that's well known and widely used.  That led to Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   The only problem with saying "use Javascript" whenever anyone
   asks how to set up custom launch options is that there's so
   much to Javascript that it might not be obvious where to
   begin.  So this section offers some working examples for
   exactly how to do it.
</p>

<h2>Selecting a user interface</h2>

<p>
   The great thing about using Javascript for this customization
   is that it gives you control over the user interface.  You can
   choose an approach that you find convenient, and that works
   well for the particular range of options you want to present.
   What works well for one game system might not be ideal for
   every system, so this flexibility is important.
</p>
<p>
   I can think of at least a few different shapes that the
   user interface might take:
</p>
<p>
   <b>Multiple Play commands:</b>
   The simplest UI is to replace the Play command in the main menu
   with two or more commands for the different available modes.
   Rather than just Play, for example, you might have
   "Play (Classic Physics)" and "Play (New Physics)".  Each
   time you launch, you select a mode simply by selecting the
   corresponding Play command.  This makes each launch into a
   two-step process, but it keeps the main menu uncluttered.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Use a submenu:</b>
   If you need more than two or three modes for a given game, it
   might make the main menu look too cluttered if you added them
   all there.  You might instead want to break up the process by
   leaving the regular Play command in the main menu, but then
   rather than having it launch the game directly, have it bring
   up a new menu listing the various mode options.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Use a separate mode setting:</b>  If you tend to play
   repeatedly in the same mode, and only switch modes rarely,
   you might prefer to have a way to set the mode as an option
   that the system remembers and reuses each time you launch
   a game.  You'd add a new menu item below Play -
   "Select Play Mode", say - which would bring up a menu with
   the various mode options.  This would look just like the
   submenu approach, but the submenu would only remember the
   mode for later, so that the regular Play command would use
   that mode until further notice.
</p>

<p>
   We'll go over the process for implementing each of these
   approaches.
</p>

<h2>Multiple Play commands</h2>

<p>
   Let's start with the simple approach of replacing the Play
   command in the main menu with several play-with-a-mode
   commands.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the basic approach to modifying any of the system menus:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Listen for the <a href="MenuEvent.html">menuopen</a> event
   <li>Check the <b>id</b> property in the event object
   <li>If it matches the ID of menu you want to modify, make the
   desired changes to the <b>items</b> array in the event object
</ul>
<p>
   In this case, we want to make two changes to the menu: we want
   to add our new menu items, and then we want to delete the
   original Play command, so that our new commands replace it.
</p>
<p>
   There's another little wrinkle.  We don't necessarily want to
   modify the Play command across the board.  We only want to
   modify it when the selected game uses the system that has the
   special modes we want to offer.  So we'll have to figure out
   which game is selected, and which system it's using, and
   use that to decide whether or not to change the menu.
</p>
<p>
   Here's how you determine the system for the current game:
</p>
<div class="code">
let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0) || { };
let sys = game.system || { };
if (sys.displayName == "Future Pinball") {
   /* it's the display name for Future Pinball */
}
</div>

<p>
   Those funny bits with the empty brackets are there to substitute
   an empty object if either the game or system object is missing entirely,
   so that we don't run into Javascript errors from trying to take properties
   of a missing object.  It's possible for there to be no game selection,
   since the user could have selected a filter that doesn't have any matching
   game.
</p>

<p>
   Note that there are several approaches we can use to identify a system.
   The easiest is to use its display name.  But that's not
   perfectly reliable, since the display name doesn't really mean anything
   special; it's just there for use in message displays, and the user could
   change it in the settings to something else at any time.  A more reliable
   way might be to use the system's executable name, and look to see if it
   ends with the expected program name:
</p>
<div class="code">
if (/\\future pinball\.exe$/i.test(sys.exe)) {
   /* it's the EXE file for Future Pinball */
}
</div>
<p>
   In the case of a Steam-based system like Pinball FX3, though, the "exe" isn't
   all that helpful, since it's always the generic Steam program.  For these
   games, we have to look at the process name setting instead:
</p>
<div class="code">
if (/pinball fx3\.exe$/i.test(sys.processName)) {
   /* it's the EXE file for Pinball FX2 */
}
</div>


<p>
   Before we add our new custom menu commands (to replace the regular Play command),
   there's one more administrative detail we have to get out of the way.  Each
   time we want to create a custom command, we have to allocate a
   <a href="Commands.html#userCommandIDs">user command ID</a>.  That lets us
   identify the command in custom menus, and in the event that fires when the
   user selects the command.  For this example, let's allocate two IDs, one for
   "play in classic physics mode" and one for "play in new physics mode".
</p>
<div class="code">
let playClassicPhysicsModeCommand = command.allocate("PlayClassicPhysicsMode");
let playNewPhysicsModeCommand = command.allocate("PlayNewPhysicsMode");
</div>

<p>
   Now we can write our menu event handler.  When the main menu opens, we'll
   if the current game is a Pinball FX3 game, we'll replace the Play command
   with the Classic and New custom commands.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "main") {
        // it's the main menu - check the current game's system
        let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0) || { };
        let sys = game.system || { };
        if (/pinball fx3\.exe$/i.test(sys.processName)) {
            // it's FX3 - add our new commands just before the existing Play command
            ev.addMenuItem(command.PlayGame, [
                { title: "Play - Classic Physics", cmd: playClassicPhysicsModeCommand },
                { title: "Play - New Physics", cmd: playNewPhysicsModeCommand }
            ]);

            // now delete the boring old regular Play command
            ev.deleteMenuItem(command.PlayGame);
        }
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Okay, we have our menu UI set up.  The only remaining work is to implement the
   handlers for our new custom commands.  We do this via a
   <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b></a> event listener:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == playClassicPhysicsModeCommand) {
        // launch in classic physics mode!
    }
    else if (ev.id == playNewPhysicsModeCommand) {
        // launch in new physics mode!
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   That just leaves the question of how we carry out these game launches.
   Fortunately, that's pretty easy: we use the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#playGame">mainWindow.playGame()</a>
   method.  By default, that method does exactly what the regular Play
   command would do: it launches the game using the options in the
   system settings for the game's associated player system.  But the
   method also lets you specify extra options that you can use to
   supplement or change the system settings.  
</p>
<p>
   In this case, the only thing we need to change is the command line
   parameters used to launch the game.  To do this, we use the
   <i>options</i> parameter to playGame() (the second argument) to
   specify an <b>overrides</b> property, which is an object containing
   a <b>params</b> property that specifies the special command line.
   It's a few levels of indirection to keep track of, so you might
   want to read through the description of playGame() if you want to
   understand how it all fits together, but it makes for a fairly
   simple and compact recipe:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.playGame(game, {
    overrides: {
        params: "custom command line options"
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   I'm going to assume that you've already set up your system settings
   with some "universal" options that apply to all games, so we'll want
   to preserve those and add the new ones special to each mode.  To get
   the standard command-line parameters, we simply retrieve the
   <b>params</b> property from the "sys" object we got earlier, which,
   you'll recall, is the descriptor for the game's system.  So we'll
   combine the original parameters with our added options, concatenating
   the two strings together into the final parameter string that we
   provide in the overrides list.
</p>

<div class="code">
mainWindow.playGame(game, {
    overrides: {
        params: "-class " + sys.params  // extra option for "classic" mode
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   This technique isn't limited to just adding a new option
   to the command line.  You can change any part of the launch: the
   executable name or path, the Windows environment variables passed
   to the program, the working folder to use, the "show window" mode
   and process termination mode, the extra commands run before and
   after the main game program.  In most cases, though, you'll
   just need to modify the command parameters.  Note that the
   simple change we've made here, of adding a new option at the
   beginning of the command line, isn't the only thing you can do.
   You could just as well use a regular expression replacement to
   substitute something in the middle of the standard parameters,
   or ignore the standard parameters entirely and provide a whole
   new string.
</p>
   
<p>
   Putting it all together, here's our full command handler:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    // check for a launch command
    let extra = undefined;
    if (ev.id == playClassicPhysicsModeCommand) {
        extra = "-class ";  // add the classic physics option code
    }
    else if (ev.id == playNewPhysicsModeCommand) {
        extra = ""; // this is the default, so there's nothing new to add
    }

    // if we found a launch command, do the launch!
    if (extra !== undefined) {
        // get the game and system information
        let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0) || { };
        let sys = game.system || { };

        // launch it with the extra options
        mainWindow.playGame(game, {
            command: ev.id,
            overrides: { params: extra + sys.params }
        });
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   We did sneak in one more little detail that we haven't mentioned
   up to this point: the <b>command</b> property in the playGame()
   options object.  This is optional, so we didn't really have to include
   it, but we added it for the sake of completeness.  Its function is to
   let you see which command was used to launch the game in your own
   event handlers, if you end up using other scripts that monitor the
   launch event.  PinballY itself doesn't use this information, but
   you might find it useful in your own future scripts to know that
   the game is being launched with one of your custom commands.
   This will appear as the <b>command</b> property in the event object
   for the <a href="LaunchEvent.html">launch events</a> related
   to this launch.
</p>

<h2>Using a submenu</h2>

<p>
   If you have more than two or three special modes for a given
   system, you might prefer going through a separate submenu
   on each launch, rather than over-stuffing the main menu with
   all of the different mode commands.
</p>
<p>
   For the sake of this example, we'll just continue working
   with the two commands we used for the main menu version above.
   It should be fairly obvious how to extend this with as many
   additional mode commands as you need - just repeat the process
   that we used for each of the commands we've defined so far.
</p>
<p>
   The first step in this new UI design is to show the submenu
   when the user selects Play from the main menu.  Unlike the
   first way we did this, where we modified the main menu to
   remove the Play, we can leave the main menu alone.  In this
   case we still want the plain old Play command.  We just want
   to change its meaning.  Rather than directly launching
   the game, the Play command will bring up our new custom
   submenu.
</p>
<p>
   The way to change the meaning of any system command is to
   listen for the <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b></a>
   event, and check the <b>id</b> in the event object to see
   if it's the command we want to change.  When it is, we carry
   out our special action, and then use
   <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a> to
   tell the system not to perform the normal command action.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.PlayGame {
        // do our special custom work

        // tell the system NOT to do its normal work for the command
        ev.preventDefault();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   In this case, the special custom work is that we want to show
   a menu.  This is quite easy: we use
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>.
   This method takes an array of menu item descriptors that lay out
   the contents of the menu we wish to show.  These are exactly like
   the menu item descriptors that we inserted into the main menu in
   our first approach above.  But since we're showing an entire menu
   this time, we should flesh it out by adding a Cancel item at the
   bottom, with a separator bar setting it off.  (A separator bar is
   just an item with an empty title string and a command ID of -1.)
</p>
<p>
   Here's the full command handler that shows our new submenu
   whenever the user selects the Play command from the main menu.
   As with the original version of the example, we only want to
   do this when the current game uses the particular system that
   has offers the extra options.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.PlayGame {
        // it's the Play command - check the current game's system
        let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0) || { };
        let sys = game.system || { };
        if (/pinball fx3\.exe$/i.test(sys.processName)) {
            // it's FX3 - show our custom submenu
            mainWindow.showMenu("custom.play.fx3", [
                { title: "Play - Classic Physics", cmd: playClassicPhysicsModeCommand },
                { title: "Play - New Physics", cmd: playNewPhysicsModeCommand },
                { cmd: -1 },  // separator
                { title: "Cancel", cmd: command.MenuReturn }
            ]);

            // tell the system not to launch the game yet
            ev.preventDefault();
        }
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   We're pretty much done!  We can just reuse the same command event
   handler from the first version of the example, since the events work the
   same way whether they're coming from the main menu or a submenu.  So
   just copy that same command handler into your code for this version.
   You'll also, of course, need those introductory lines from the first
   example that allocated the command IDs via command.allocate().
</p>

<h2>Mode selections</h2>

<p>
   The third way we could approach this is to use settings that stick,
   rather than forcing the user to go through a mode selection on every
   Play command.  You might prefer this approach if you tend to stay
   in one mode most of the time, since it simplifies each individual
   game launch action: there's no need to go through a list of Play
   commands or a submenu every time.
</p>
<p>
   The plan here is as follows.  First, we'll leave the Play command
   on the main menu as it is, but we'll change its meaning slightly,
   so that it launches the game using the current mode setting, whatever
   that is.  Second, we'll add a new "Set Play Mode" option to the main
   menu, under the existing Play command.  This new command will bring
   up a submenu that lets you select the mode to use from that point
   forward.  This new menu will look just like the submenu we created
   in the second iteration above, with a list of mode options, but
   we'll modify it slightly by adding a radio button marker next to
   the mode that's currently selected.  That'll show the user which
   mode is active at a glance each time they open the menu.
</p>
<p>
   The code to implement the submenu is very much like the submenu
   code in the second iteration above.  The only change we need to
   make is to add the radio button.  We'll also have to remember
   which setting is currently active.  We'll do that using a
   global variable.  As with the earlier examples, we're going
   to stick with our two physics mode options, leaving it to
   you to add any additional (or different) options you want
   for your custom setup.
</p>
<p>
   The final step is to override the regular Play command.
   We intercept the command just like we did in the second
   iteration, but this time we go directly to the game launch,
   using the current mode setting, rather than bringing up
   a submenu.  
</p>
<p>
   The assembled code is mostly a combination and rearrangement
   of the first two versions, so it shouldn't require too much
   more explanation now that we've laid out the pieces.  Here's
   what the finished version looks like.
</p>

<div class="code">
// Global variable for keeping track of the current FX3 play
// mode.  We'll use the strings "classic" and "new" to represent
// the modes.  Initially, we'll restore the saved value from the
// settings file.
let currentFX3ModeKey = "custom.fx3.playMode";
let currentFX3Mode = optionSettings.get(currentFX3ModeKey, "classic");

// in the main menu, add our new Set Play Mode command after the
// Play command
let setPlayModeCommand = command.allocate("SetPlayMode");
mainWindow.on("showmenu", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "main") {
        // main menu - check the current game's system
        let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0) || { };
        let sys = game.system || { };
        if (/pinball fx3\.exe$/i.test(sys.processName)) {
            // it's FX3 - add the Set Play Mode command

        }
    }
});

// Show the mode selection menu when the Set Play Mode command
// is used, and process the commands in that menu.

            mainWindow.showMenu("custom.playmode.fx3", [
                {
                    title: "Classic Physics Mode",
                    cmd: classicPhysicsModeCommand,
                    radio: currentFX3Mode == "classic"
                },
                {
                    title: "New Physics Mode",
                    cmd: newPhysicsModeCommand,

                },

                { title: "Cancel", cmd: command.MenuReturn }
            ]);

            // tell the system not to launch the game yet
            ev.preventDefault();
        }
    }
    else if (ev.id == classicPhysicsModeCommand) {

                extra = "-class ";
            else if (currentFX3Mode == "new")
                extra = "";

            // launch it with the extra options
            mainWindow.playGame(game, {
                overrides: { params: extra + sys.params }
            });
