<h1>SettingsEvent</h1>

<p>
   Events of this class are fired when the option settings file is
   saved or reloaded.
</p>
<p>
   This event has the following subtypes:
<ul>
   <li><b>settingspresave:</b>  Fires immediately before the program
   saves its in-memory configuration to the settings file.  This gives
   you a chance to save any in-memory settings to the configuration
   so that it'll be included in the saved file.  This event can't
   be canceled.

   <li><b>settingspostsave:</b>  Fires immediately after the settings
   file has been saved.  This event can't be canceled.

   <li><b>settingsreload:</b> Fires immediately after the settings file is
   reloaded.  The file is reloaded whenever the user makes any changes
   in the settings dialog, to ensure that all of the new settings are
   applied throughout the program.  The event occurs after the fact,
   so it can't be canceled.

</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="OptionSettingsObject.html">optionSettings</a> object.
</p>

<h2>Save events</h2>

<p>
   PinballY keeps a copy of the settings in memory for quick access.
   When something changes - say, the user activates a new filter in
   the wheel API - the change is recorded in the in-memory copy of
   the settings, but isn't immediately saved to the file.  This avoids
   the need to constantly re-write the file every time the user presses
   a button, which would slow things down slightly in the UI.
</p>
<p>
   Whenever a change is made to the in-memory copy of the settings, the
   program sets an internal flag saying that the in-memory
   copy is "dirty" (that is, modified relative to the file copy).
   From time to time, the program checks the flag and automatically
   saves any pending changes.
</p>
<p>
   The user never has to enter an explicit "Save" command to save changes.
   The program saves changes any pending automatically, at various times:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Just before quitting

   <li>Just before launching a game

   <li>Just before showing the Options dialog

   <li>Any time the UI has been idle for about 15 seconds
</ul>



<h2>Reload events</h2>

<p>
   The program automatically reloads the option settings file any time the
   user makes changes in the Settings dialog.
</p>
<p>
   Reloading the settings file also requires reloading the game databases
   and game file lists, since changes to the settings can affect which
   files are included in the scans and which databases are loaded.
   Games that were previously loaded into the in-memory game list
   might be removed from memory as a result.  Any <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   objects or <a href="GameInfo.html#gameID">game ID</a> values that referred
   to such games will become invalid, so you could use this event
   to clear any global variables or other cached information you might
   be keeping on loaded games.
</p>
<p>
   Any table media files (playfield videos or images, etc) currently being
   displayed are also reloaded.
</p>
   


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>succeeded:</b>  For <b>settingspostchange</b> events only,
   this is a boolean value indicating whether or not the settings 
   file was successfully saved.  <b>true</b> means that the save was
   successful, <b>false</b> means that an error occurred writing the
   file.

</ul>
