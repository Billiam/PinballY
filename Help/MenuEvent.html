<h1>MenuEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when a system menu is displayed or any
   menu is closed.  There are two subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>menuopen:</b> Fires when a system menu is about to be displayed.
   No event is fired when a user menu is opened via
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>.
   The menu display can be stopped by calling
   <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a> on the
   event object (passed as a parameter to your event handler).

   <li><b>menuclose:</b>  Fires when any menu (including both system menus
   and user menus) has just been closed.  This event is fired after the
   fact, so it's not possible to prevent the menu from being closed.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.

<h2>Overriding a system menu</h2>

<p>
   You can use the <b>menuopen</b> event to prevent any system menu from
   displaying, to add or remove items from the default system menu, or to
   display your own entirely custom menu in place of a system menu.  In
   all cases, you do this by canceling the default system handling of the
   <b>menuopen</b> event, which would otherwise proceed by showing the
   standard system menu, and then optionally displaying your own menu
   via <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   <b>To suppress a system menu:</b>  simply cancel the <b>menuopen</b> event
   when that menu is about to be opened.  For example, this will
   prevent the Exit menu from ever showing:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", (ev) => {
    if (ev.id == "exit")
        ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>

<p>
   <b>To modify a system menu:</b>  You can modify any system menu
   by taking advantage of the .items property of the <b>menuopen</b>
   event object, which gives you the complete contents of the menu
   that the system is about to display.  The list in the same format that
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>
   uses to describe to be displayed, so it has all of the information
   you'd need to build an identical custom menu of your own.
</p>
<p>
   Now, you can't just change the .items list in the event object
   and expect the displayed menu to change.  This list is provided
   for your information only.  The system keeps its own private copy,
   and it uses that private copy when it's time to actually display
   the menu on-screen.  However,
   remember that you can entirely prevent the proposed menu from
   being displayed at all, by calling preventDefault() on the event
   object, and that you can display an entirely custom menu of your
   own at any time via mainWindow.showMenu().  So the trick to
   modifying a system menu is to put those two features together:
   you first cancel the <b>menuopen</b> event to prevent the system
   menu from being shown, then you call showMenu() with your modified
   version of the .items list from the event.  Since the .items list
   is already in the same format that showMenu() expects for its
   <i>items</i> argument, you don't have to build a completely new
   menu list for showMenu().  You can just pass the .items list from
   the event after making any insertions, deletions, or edits that
   you wish to make.
</p>
<p>
   For example, if you want to change the name of the "Play" command
   on the main menu to "Run Game", you could do something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", (ev) => {
    if (ev.id = "main") {
        // edit the menu items
        ev.items.foreach(i => {
            if (i.cmd == command.PlayGame)
                i.title = "Run Game";
        });

        // cancel the original menu display
        ev.preventDefault();

        // show our modified version of the menu
        mainWindow.showMenu(ev.id, ev.items, ev.options);
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   <b>To replace a system menu with an entirely custom menu:</b>  This is 
   just like editing a system menu, as in the example above, except that you'd
   ignore the original items list in the event and build your own from scratch, with
   your desired list of custom menu items.
</p>
   


<h2>Timing of open/close events</h2>

<p>
   The sequencing of the <b>menuopen</b> and <b>menuclose</b> events can
   be a little confusing when switching straight from one menu to another,
   such as when navigating into a submenu.  The thing that's confusing is
   that the <b>menuopen</b> for the new menu will fire <i>before</i> the
   <b>menuclose</b> for the old menu fires.
</p>
<p>
   To understand why, we have to look at the timing of the open/close events
   individually.
   The <b>menuopen</b> event is sent <i>before</i> the new menu is displayed.
   This is important because it gives you a chance to intervene, by canceling
   the new menu display entirely or by altering its contents.
   The <b>menuclose</b> event is sent <i>after</i> the old menu is removed.
   This event represents a fait accompli; it's not possible to prevent the
   menu from being closed, since it's already gone by the time the event
   occurs.
</p>
<p>
   Now, putting those two bits of timing together, we can see what happens
   when the user does something that switches directly from one menu to another.
   The <b>menuopen</b> event for the new menu occurs first, <i>before</i>
   the <b>menuclose</b> event for the old menu is fired.  That's a necessary
   consequence of the <b>menuopen</b> handler's ability to intervene in the
   new menu setup, because the display of the new menu is what actually triggers
   the removal of the old menu.  If your <b>menuopen</b> handler cancels the
   new menu before it's been opened, any old menu will remain displayed, so a
   <b>menuclose</b> event for the old menu before the <b>menopen</b> event
   for the new menu would have been premature.
</p>
<p>
   The reason we point this out is that it might seem reasonable to think
   that a <b>menuclose</b> event means that a menu is no longer
   being displayed.  It doesn't actually mean that, though, because the
   outgoing menu could have been replaced with a new menu by the time
   the close event fired. 
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following
   additional items:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b>  a string with the menu ID of the menu that's about
   to be opened or that just closed.  See <a href="Menus.html#systemMenus">system menus</a>
   for list of IDs strings for the standard menus.

   <li><b>items:</b>  for the <b>menuopen</b> event, an array of objects
   describing the items in the menu that's about to be opened.  The list
   is in the same format as the <i>items</i> argument in
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>,
   so you can pass this as an argument to that function to show a menu
   with the same contents.  Modifying the list has no effect on the
   menu displayed if you allow the <b>menuopen</b> to proceed to the
   system handling, but you can cancel the event to prevent this menu
   from showing, and call showMenu() with your own item list instead.
   This property isn't present for <b>menuclose</b> events.

   <li><b>options:</b>  for the <b>menuopen</b> event, an object with
   properties describing the menu options, in the same format as the
   <i>options</i> argument to 
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">mainWindow.showMenu()</a>.
   Modifying the object has no effect on the menu displayed if you
   allow the <b>menuopen</b> event to proceed to the system handling,
   but you can cancel the event to prevent this menu from showing,
   and call showMenu() with your own options instead.
   This property isn't present for <b>menuclose</b> events.
</ul>
