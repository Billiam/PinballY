<h1>Info Box Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you customize the information box that normally
   pops up whenever a game is selected.  (These settings don't affect
   the "full" information box that you can access via the "Information"
   command on the main menu.  These only affect the automatic box
   that pops up on its own when a game is selected.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>Show the automatic game info box:</b>  This box controls
   whether or not the box is shown at all.  This is checked by
   default.  Un-check the box if you want to remove the box entirely.

   pinball player program that the table was created with
   (Visual Pinball, Future Pinball, etc).
</p>

<p>
   <b>Include the rating:</b> Shows the "star" rating for the game.
<p>

   or other system-specific file that contains the game.

<h2>Manufacturer logos</h2>

<p>
   PinballY doesn't come with graphics for the manufacturer company
   logos, since most of the logos are official trademarks.  If you
   wish to provide your own graphics files for the company logos, though,
   it's easy to install them.
</p>
<p>
   File formats:  use PNG files for all logos.  Use transparency ("alpha")
   as desired.
</p>
<p>
   Location:  place all company logo files in the <b>Company Logos</bL
   subfolder of your main Media folder, as set in your Folders options.
</p>
<p>
   Name: simply use the manufacturer name as the file name (before the .png
   suffix), as in <b>Gottlieb.png</b> or <b>Williams.png</b>.
</p>
<p>
   Era-specific files:  many company logos change over the years.  You can
   create separate logos for a manufacturer over different time periods
   by adding a year range suffix to the filename, as in
   <b>Gottlieb (1971-1980).png</b>.  You can use as many different time
   periods as necessary for each company.  Use a range like <b>(1980-)</b>
   to mean "1980 and later".
</p>

<h2>System logos</h2>

<p>
   You can create your own system logos for the player systems (Visual
   Pinball, etc) as follows:
</p>
<p>
   File formats: use PNG files.  Use transparency ("alpha") as desired.
</p>
<p>
   Location: place all system logos in the <b>System Logos</b> subfolder
   of your main Media folder, as set in your Folders options.
</p>
<p>
   Name: simply use the system name as the file name (before the .png
   suffix), as in <b>Visual Pinball.png</b>.  The name should match
   the display name in the option settings for the system.
</p>
<p>
   Version-specific and version-independent names:  Names are matched
   by prefix, so a file named <b>Visual Pinball.png</b> will match
   systems named <b>Visual Pinball 9</b>, <b>Visual Pinball X</b>, etc.
   If there's an exact match, as in <b>Visual Pinball X.png</b>, that
   will take precedence over a generic prefix match.
