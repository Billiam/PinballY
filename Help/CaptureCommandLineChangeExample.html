<h1>Custom game launch options for media capture</h1>

<p>
   In some cases, you might want to use different command-line options
   when launching Visual Pinball (or another game system) for a media
   capture session, vs. the regular options for a regular game play
   session.
</p>
<p>
   I know of one special case where this is particularly useful, which
   is VP's "true full screen" mode.  Many people normally run VP in
   Exclusive Full Screen mode, because the version of DirectX that
   VP is based on can achieve better GPU performance in that mode.
   But this creates a problem for media capture operations: by its
   very nature, "exclusive" mode means that only one program can
   access the video display.  So putting the display in "exclusive"
   mode means that FFMPEG can't capture the video, defeating the
   whole purpose of the media capture operation.
</p>
<p>
   At least one person has proposed adding a special feature to PinballY
   to turn off VP's exclusive mode when running a capture.  But I can't
   see a way to do that without building knowledge of that very specific
   feature of VP into PinballY.  I try to avoid making PinballY know
   special things about VP, because I want PinballY to work with <i>any</i>
   game system you want to use it with.  Special handling for VP
   violates that principle of generality.
</p>
<p>
   So instead of building special knowledge of VP into PinballY, I'll
   provide this worked example showing how you can use Javascript
   to perform this kind of extremely specific customization.  This
   is the only way I see that makes it general enough to apply the
   same idea to other systems that might need something similar.
</p>

<h2>Launch events and command lines</h2>

<p>
   The approach we're going to use is to listen for a <b>prelaunch</b>
   event.  That event fires when a game is about to be launched, and
   it gives Javascript a chance to do all of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Determine which game is being launched
   <li>Find out which game system is going to be used (VP, FP, etc)
   <li>See whether we're launching for a regular game session or a media capture operation
   <li>Change the command line as needed
</ul>

<p>
   So this lets us accomplish our goal here: when we see a VP X game
   being launched for a media capture operation, we'll sneak in and
   add the "disableTrueFullScreen" option to the VP command line.
</p>

<p>
   This example uses a number of system objects, which you can find
   full details on in other chapters:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <b>prelaunch</b> event is part of the <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a> group
   <li>The <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object contains information on the game being launched
   <li>The <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object contains information the game system
       (in other words, the program that we launch to play the game, such as Visual Pinball)
   <li><a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> has a list of the command codes, which is what we use to
   distinguish regular "play" launches from media capture launches
</ul>


<p>
   Here's the script:
</p>

<div class="code">
// Intercept the prelaunch event, which fires each time a game is
// about to be launched.  This fires BEFORE the launch process starts,
// so it gives us an opportunity to edit the command line that will be
// used to launch the program.
mainWindow.on("prelaunch", ev => {
    // check to see if we're in Media Capture mode AND this is VP X
    if (ev.command == command.CaptureGo && game.system.systemClass == "VPX") {
        // We're launching a Visual Pinball X game in media capture mode.
        // Edit the command line to add the /disableTrueFullScreen option flag.
        ev.overrides.params = gameSysInfo.params + " /disableTrueFullScreen";
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   The overall body of the code is simply an event listener for the
   <b>prelaunch</b> event.  As mentioned above, a listener for this event has the ability
   to modify anything about the command line for the game that's about to
   be launched.
</p>
<p>
   The first thing the event listener does is check the command to see
   if it's a media capture command (command.CaptureGo) and that the
   game system is Visual Pinball X.  The special command-line option
   that we want to insert only applies to that particular situation -
   we wouldn't want to add it to a Future Pinball launch, for example.
</p>
<p>
   Note that we detect that the game is a Visual Pinball X game by
   checking the "system class" of the game system that we're about
   to launch.  The "game system" is simply PinballY's internal data
   record describing the program.  This corresponds exactly to one
   of the game systems that you can edit in the Settings dialog.
   The "system class" is one of the game system properties that you
   can select in the dialog.  Even though I made a big deal earlier
   about how PinballY tries to avoid special knowledge of Visual
   Pinball (or any other particular game system), there are a <i>few</i>
   special cases that PinballY does have to handle, which is why it lets
   you specify that a particular system is VP, VPX, FP, or Steam-based.
   The script takes advantage of the fact that we have this way to
   specially designate VPX among the system data records.  If you
   wanted to create a similar script that detects launches for some
   <i>other</i> game system that <i>doesn't</i> have a special system
   class in PinballY, you could use one of the other GameSysInfo
   properties to detect the system.  One way would be to identify
   it by name, using the <b>displayName</b> property of the GameSysInfo
   object.  I consider that a little unreliable because you can
   really set it to anything you want to for any system; it's just
   there for display purposes, not for absolute identification.
   A better way might be to check the <b>defExt</b> property,
   which tells you the filename extension used by the system's games;
   that might be unique enough to be reliable.  Another option
   would be to look at the <b>exe</b> property, which tells you
   the EXE program file's name; that might also be unique enough
   to reliably identify the system.
</p>
<p>
   Once we've identified the system as VPX, and identified the
   command as a Media Capture operation, we spring into action.
   The goal here is to get VP <i>not</i> to use exclusive
   full-screen mode for this session.  VP helpfully provides a
   command-line option that does exactly that, <b>/disableTrueFullScreen</b>.
   So all we have to do is append that option to the command line
   options that we were going to provide for a normal launch.
   To get the original options, we just look at the <b>params</b>
   property of the system's GameSysInfo object.  That gives us
   the exact text that you typed into the Settings dialog for
   this system.  In the case of VPX, we can add new option flags
   simply by stringing them along at the end of the rest of the
   command line, so we use the Javascript string "+" operator
   to append the option at the end.
</p>
<p>
   Note that some other systems might need options to be inserted
   at the beginning of the command line, or pasted into the middle.
   This is one more reason that it's not easy to generalize this
   into something that we could have built into PinballY itself.
   Command-line syntax on Windows is inherently idiosyncratic,
   so we can't say in general that "new options always go at the
   end" or whatever else.  New options go where the particular
   program says they go.
