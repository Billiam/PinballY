<h1>Custom Game Command Line for Media Capture</h1>

<p>
   In some cases, you might want to use different command-line options
   when launching Visual Pinball (or another game system) for a media
   capture session, vs. the regular options for a regular game play
   session.
</p>
<p>
   I know of one special case where this is particularly useful, which
   is VP's "true full screen" mode.  Many people normally run VP in
   Exclusive Full Screen mode, because the version of DirectX that
   VP is based on can achieve better GPU performance in that mode.
   But this creates a problem for media capture operations: by its
   very nature, "exclusive" mode means that only one program can
   access the video display.  So putting the display in "exclusive"
   mode means that FFMPEG can't capture the video, defeating the
   whole purpose of the media capture operation.
</p>
<p>
   At least one person has proposed adding a special feature to PinballY
   to turn off VP's exclusive mode when running a capture.  But I can't
   see a way to do that without building knowledge of that very specific
   feature of VP into PinballY.  I try to avoid making PinballY know
   special things about VP, because I want PinballY to work with <i>any</i>
   game system you want to use it with.  Special handling for VP
   violates that principle of generality.
</p>
<p>
   So instead of building special knowledge of VP into PinballY, I'll
   provide this worked example showing how you can use Javascript
   to perform this kind of extremely specific customization.  This
   is the only way I see that makes it general enough to apply the
   same idea to other systems that might need something similar.
</p>

<h2>Launch events and command lines</h2>

<p>
   The approach we're going to use is to listen for a <b>prelaunch</b>
   event.  That event fires when a game is about to be launched, and
   it gives Javascript a chance to do all of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Determine which game is being launched
   <li>Find out which game system is going to be used (VP, FP, etc)
   <li>See whether we're launching for a regular game session or a media capture operation
   <li>Change the command line as needed
</ul>

<p>
   So this lets us accomplish our goal here: when we see a VP X game
   being launched for a media capture operation, we'll sneak in and
   add the "disableTrueFullScreen" option to the VP command line.
</p>

<p>
   This example uses a number of system objects, which you can find
   full details on in other chapters:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <b>prelaunch</b> event is part of the <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a> group
   <li>The <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object contains information on the game being launched
   <li>The <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object contains information the game system
       (in other words, the program that we launch to play the game, such as Visual Pinball)
   <li><a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> has a list of the command codes, which is what we use to
   distinguish regular "play" launches from media capture launches
</ul>


<p>
   Here's the script:
</p>

<div class="code">
// Intercept the prelaunch event, which fires each time a game is
// about to be launched.  This fires BEFORE the launch process starts,
// so it gives us an opportunity to edit the command line that will be
// used to launch the program.
mainWindow.on("prelaunch", ev => {
    // check to see if we're in Media Capture mode AND this is VP X
    if (ev.command == command.CaptureGo && game.system.systemClass == "VPX") {
        // We're launching a Visual Pinball X game in media capture mode.
        // Edit the command line to add the /disableTrueFullScreen option flag.
        ev.overrides.params = gameSysInfo.params + " /disableTrueFullScreen";
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   The overall body of the code is simply an event listener for the
   <b>prelaunch</b> event.  As mentioned above, a listener for this event has the ability
   to modify anything about the command line for the game that's about to
   be launched.
</p>
<p>
   The first thing the event listener does is check the command to see
   if it's a media capture command (command.CaptureGo) and that the
   game system is Visual Pinball X.  The special command-line option
   that we want to insert only applies to that particular situation -
   we wouldn't want to add it to a Future Pinball launch, for example.
</p>
<p>
   Note that we detect that the game is a Visual Pinball X game by
   checking the "system class" of the game system that we're about
   to launch.  The "game system" is simply PinballY's internal data
   record describing the program.  This corresponds exactly to one
   of the game systems that you can edit in the Settings dialog.
   The "system class" is one of the game system properties that you
   can select in the dialog.  Even though I made a big deal earlier
   about how PinballY tries to avoid special knowledge of Visual
   Pinball (or any other particular game system), there are a <i>few</i>
   special cases that PinballY does have to handle, which is why it lets
   you specify that a particular system is VP, VPX, FP, or Steam-based.
   The script takes advantage of the fact that we have this way to
   specially designate VPX among the system data records.  If you
   wanted to create a similar script that detects launches for some
   <i>other</i> game system that <i>doesn't</i> have a special system
   class in PinballY, you could use one of the other GameSysInfo
   properties to detect the system.  One way would be to identify
   it by name, using the <b>displayName</b> property of the GameSysInfo
   object.  I consider that a little unreliable because you can
   really set it to anything you want to for any system; it's just
   there for display purposes, not for absolute identification.
   A better way might be to check the <b>defExt</b> property,
   which tells you the filename extension used by the system's games;
   that might be unique enough to be reliable.  Another option
   would be to look at the <b>exe</b> property, which tells you
   the EXE program file's name; that might also be unique enough
   to reliably identify the system.
</p>
<p>
   Once we've identified the system as VPX, and identified the
   command as a Media Capture operation, we spring into action.
   The goal here is to get VP <i>not</i> to use exclusive
   full-screen mode for this session.  VP helpfully provides a
   command-line option that does exactly that, <b>/disableTrueFullScreen</b>.
   So all we have to do is append that option to the command line
   options that we were going to provide for a normal launch.
   To get the original options, we just look at the <b>params</b>
   property of the system's GameSysInfo object.  That gives us
   the exact text that you typed into the Settings dialog for
   this system.  In the case of VPX, we can add new option flags
   simply by stringing them along at the end of the rest of the
   command line, so we use the Javascript string "+" operator
   to append the option at the end.
</p>
<p>
   Note that some other systems might need options to be inserted
   at the beginning of the command line, or pasted into the middle.
   This is one more reason that it's not easy to generalize this
   into something that we could have built into PinballY itself.
   Command-line syntax on Windows is inherently idiosyncratic,
   so we can't say in general that "new options always go at the
   end" or whatever else.  New options go where the particular
   program says they go.
</p>

<h2>Adapting the script to other game systems</h2>

<p>
   The "Exclusive Full Screen" media capture issue will apply to any
   game system that uses Exclusive Full Screen mode.  The same technique
   we used in the script above should be adaptable to other systems.
   Javascript lets you have as many <b>prelaunch</b> event listeners
   as you want, so you can just add another event listener based on the
   one above for each system that needs one.
</p>
<p>
   The first step in adapting the event listener to a new system is
   to recognize the new system.  If the system has a sufficiently
   unique filename extension that identifies its games, that should
   be a reliable way to identify it:
</p>
<div class="code">
if (command == command.CaptureGo && game.system.defExt == ".somepin")
</div>
<p>
   If the system doesn't use game files, or doesn't have a unique
   enough default extension, you could rely on the executable filename.
   The <b>exe</b> property of the GameSysInfo object gives us the
   full name, with drive letter and directory path prefix, so you
   might want to use a regular expression to just look for the
   main file name portion:
</p>
<div class="code">
if (command == command.CaptureGo && /\\somepinplayer\.exe$/i.test(game.system.exe))
</div>

<p>
   Once you've identified the system, all that remains is to 
   tell the program being launched not to use Exclusive Full Screen mode
   for the current session.  Exactly how you do that is up to the particular
   player program you're using:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the system has a command-line option similar to VPX's
   /disableTrueFullScreen, it's a simple matter of inserting the option
   into the default parameters using <b>ev.overrides.params</b>, just
   like the example above.  You just have to replace VP's /disableTrueFullScreen
   with the corresponding option flag for the particular program.  You
   might also have to change where it's inserted into the original
   parameters; VPX is happy to have the parameter tacked onto the
   end, but other systems might need it inserted at the beginning
   of the other parameters, or at some point in the middle.  Each
   program defines its own command-line syntax, so there's no general
   rule to follow here; you just have to figure out how the program
   you're working with expects the parameter.

   <li>Some programs might not have a command-line option for this
   at all, but might instead store the option in a settings file,
   for example, or in the Windows registry.  In that case, you'd have
   to write Javascript code to update the program's setting file,
   registry keys, etc.  PinballY's Javascript has access to all
   of the Windows API functions, so this is all doable: see
   <a href="DllImport.html">Calling Native DLLs from Javascript</a>
   for details on how to access native Windows functions.  File
   system access is easiest through the Windows "Scripting.FileSystemObject"
   interface; see <a href="OLEAutomation.html">OLE Automation Objects</a> for
   more on accessing that sort of thing.
   <p>
      Note that if you do have to change the contents of a settings file,
      registry key, or something of that sort, you'll probably also
      want to restore the original settings after the game finishes.
      You can do that by setting up a separate event listener
      for the <b>postlaunch</b> event, which you can read about in the
      <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a> chapter.  That event
      is the end-of-game counterpart of <b>prelaunch</b>, so it gives
      you a chance to "clean up" anything that you did before launching
      the game.  The most elegant way to handle this would be via a
      "once" event listener, since that sets up a handler that's called
      exactly once and then discarded.  So the <b>prelaunch</b>
      handler would look something like this:
   </p>
   <div class="code">
mainWindow.on("prelaunch", ev => {
    if (command == command.CaptureGo && game.system.defExt == ".somepin") {

        // *** make the settings change here ***

        // ...and then set up an event listener to undo the settings
        // changes after the game exits
        mainWindow.once("postlaunch", ev => {

            // *** restore the original settings here ***

        });
   });</div>
   <p>
      That will neatly install the cleanup event listener only when it's needed,
      and automatically remove the event listener after it runs.  That
      eliminates any need for the event handler to check global variables
      or anything like that to see if it needs to do its work; the fact
      that it's running is enough to know that it should go ahead and
      undo the changes.
   </p>
