<h1>Audio/Video Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Enable videos:</b>  Check this box to enable video playback in the
   display windows (playfield, backglass, DMD, topper).  Normally, video
   files are displayed whenever present, in preference to still graphics,
   since videos provide a visually richer presentation.  Still graphics
   are normally only displayed when no video file is available.  If you
   un-check this box, any video files will be ignored and still graphics
   will be presented instead.
</p>
<p>
   You can use this option if video playback is places too much of a load
   on your system.  Alternatively, you can simply delete video files or
   move them out of the media folders, but this option is obviously more
   convenient if you only want to disable videos temporarily.
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>Mute videos:</b>  Check this box to mute video playback.  Audio is
   only used for the main playfield video, so other videos are always
   muted.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Mute buttons:</b>  Check this box to mute the sound effects for
   button presses in the user interface.
