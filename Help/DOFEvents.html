<h1>DOF Events</h1>

<p>
   If DOF is installed on your system, PinballY generates
   DOF events to trigger effects from your feedback devices (such as
   solenoids and flasher lights).  This will fire flashers and other
   devices on certain events, such as when you switch between
   tables in the table list.
</p>
<p>
   DOF integration is automatic.
   To take advantage of it, just make sure that DOF is installed
   and that your .ini files from the
   <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>
   are up to date.  The PinballY definitions were added to the
   Config Tool database in late July 2018, so you'll need to generate
   and download fresh copies if your current .ini files are older
   than that.
</p>
<p>
   You can disable PinballY's DOF usage entirely via the
   <a href="DOFOptions.html">DOF Options</a> page in the Settings
   dialog.
</p>

<h2>DOF setup</h2>
<p>
   If you use a "cabinet config" file with DOF, it's important to create
   a DOF global config file for PinballY.  DOF requires a separate global
   config file for each program.  The DOF global config file for PinballY
   is called <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
</p>
<p>
   <b>This is only needed if you're <i>already</i> using a global config
   file for other programs.</b>  That file must be set up manually, so if
   you never went through that manual process for other programs, you don't
   have to do it now.  The global config is generally only required if you
   have certain hardware devices that DOF can't detect automatically, such
   as addressable LED light strips.
</p>
<p>
   The easiest way to create the PinballY global config file is to copy your
   existing global config for B2SServer (that's the one that Visual Pinball
   uses, so most people who need the file at all have the B2SServer file):
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open your main DOF install folder
   <li>Open the <b>Config</b> subfolder
   <li>Make a copy of <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b>
   <li>Rename the copy <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>
</ul>
<p>
   In the future, if you make any changes to any of your global config files,
   remember to make the same changes to your GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml file while
   you're at it.  (It's not ideal that we have to make duplicate changes like
   that, but unfortunately that's just the way DOF is designed.)
</p>
<p>
   If you don't create a GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml file, DOF uses its
   default option settings for PinballY.  That's fine in most cases; the
   main exception is when you have certain types of hardware devices in
   your DOF setup that DOF can't discover on its own, particularly
   "smart" LED strips (the "addressable" kind, where each LED can be set
   to a separate color).  In those cases, DOF needs a <b>cabinet config</b>
   file to find the special devices, and the way it finds the cabinet
   config file is through the global config file.  So, if DOF is partially
   working on your system, but isn't using your smart LED strips (or
   other individual devices), you probably just need to create the PinballY
   copy of the global config file, as described above.
</p>

<h2>How PinballY communicates with DOF</h2>
<p>
   PinballY and DOF communicate using "named events".  A named
   event is an abstract label that PinballY defines to represent
   some particular action in the program.  All of PinballY's
   named events are listed in the sections below.  They all
   start with the prefix <b>PBY</b> to help clarify that they're
   PinballY custom events.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY's custom events represent abstract program actions,
   <i>not</i> particular physical effects in DOF.  So, for
   example, you won't find a PBY event for "turn on the shaker motor".
   The PinballY events all relate to things that happen in the
   PinballY UI, such as "user pressed the left flipper button"
   (PBYFlipperLeft) or "a new game was selected" (PBYGameSelect).
</p>
<p>
   So how does DOF turn these abstract PinballY UI events into physical
   device effects?  How does DOF
   know that we want to fire the left flipper solenoid when you
   press the left flipper button, for example, or flash a pattern
   of lights when you navigate to a new game?   Those associations
   come from the DOF Config Tool.  In fact, this is really the whole
   point of the DOF Config Tool: it lets you specify the associations
   between abstract program events and physical device effects.
</p>
<p>
   The full details of setting up these associations in the Config Tool are beyond
   the scope of what we can cover here, so you should follow the
   DOF documentation links above if you want to learn more.  The link you'll
   probably want to look at first is the Pinscape Build Guide's 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=dofEventCodes">DOF Event Codes</a>
   chapter, since that's all about exactly this subject.  (It's
   also the only comprehensive reference to the Config Tool syntax
   that I'm aware of.)
</p>
<p>
   The DOF Config Tool's database already includes a set of pre-defined
   rules for the PinballY custom events, so you should see DOF effects
   fire automatically when you use PinballY, as long as your config
   files are all up-to-date.  You can also fully customize the DOF
   effects by editing the rules defined for the pseudo-table called
   <b>PinballY</b> in the Config Tool.  (The DOF rules are defined on a
   game-by-game basis, since DOF thinks in terms of pinball simulation.
   So programs like PinballY that aren't really pinball simulators
   at all, but which still want to use DOF effects, have to pretend
   to be pinball games.)
</p>
   

<h2>Customizing DOF effects</h2>
<p>
   You can customize all of PinballY's DOF effects via the
   <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The Config Tool's database  includes a predefined set of
   effects for PinballY, so you don't have to do anything to use
   the standard effects other than making sure your .ini files are
   up-to-date.  If you want to customize anything, though, the
   Config Tool lets you override any of the default effects with
   your own custom settings.
</p>

<p>
   Here's how you can access the PinballY settings in the DOF Config Tool:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In your Web browser, open the <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>
   <li>Log in
   <li>Click <b>Table Configs</b> in the top navigation bar
   <li>Select <b>PinballY</b> from the Table Names drop list
</ul>

<p>
   All of the PinballY DOF effects are defined under this
   "PinballY" pseudo-table.  As far as DOF is concerned, PinballY is
   just another pinball table.  The lists below show all of
   PinballY's custom named events - they all start with <b>PBY</b>
   as short-hand to clarify that they're PinballY-specific.
</p>
<p>
   When looking at the DOF Config Tool rules for the PinballY
   pseudo-table, there are a couple of special syntax elements
   you should be aware of:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, the Config Tool uses a <b>$</b> prefix to signify named effects,
   so you have to add the <b>$</b> prefix to the names in the lists below.
   For example, you'd write <b>$PBYWheelNext</b> in the Config Tool
   field if you want something to trigger on a "wheel next" event.

   <li>Second, the special syntax <b>@allrgb@</b> in a rule lets you
   use the RGB coloring for the device where the rule appears that's
   associated with the game currently selected in the PinballY wheel.
   For example, putting <b>@allrgb@</b> in the "RGB Flippers" field
   makes the flipper buttons light up in the colors for whichever
   table is currently selected in the PinballY wheel display.  This
   special syntax can only be used in RGB device rules.
</ul>
<p>
   For more information on the Config Tool rule syntax, refer to the DOF documentation links above, particularly
   <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=dofEventCodes">DOF Event Codes</a>
   in the Pinscape Build Guide.
</p>


<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
   Each time something DOF-worthy happens in the PinballY user
   interface, PinballY fires a named DOF event.  For example, when
   you press the Next button (usually the right flipper button) to
   switch to the next game, PinballY fires a <b>PBYWheelNext</b> event.
</p>
<p>
   "Fires an event" means that PinballY briefly pulses the event ON
   and then OFF.  More technically, ON means that the event's
   "brightness" value is set to 255, and OFF means that it's set to 0.
   We put "brightness" in quotes because these events don't truly
   represent anything with a brightness or intensity; they're just
   arbitrary labels for discrete UI actions.  In any case, you
   don't normally have to worry about the numeric brightness in
   the Config Tool syntax anyway, since what usually matters when
   you're writing the rules is just that
   an event was switched between OFF (0) and ON (any non-zero value).
<p>
   Here's a list of the events that PinballY fires:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>PBYAttractA1</b> through <b>PBYAttractA5:</b> When attract mode is
      running, these events are fired in order (1 through 5) at 1-second
      intervals.  After reaching 5, the counter loops back to 1.  This can
      be used to create a series of events that runs on a 5-second loop.

   <li><b>PBYAttractB1</b> through <b>PBYAttractB60:</b> When attract
      mode is running, these events fire in order (1 through 60) at 1-second
      intervals, looping back to 1 after reaching the last event.  This can
      be used to create a series of events that runs on a 60-second loop.

   <li><b>PBYAttractR1</b> through <b>PBYAttractR5:</b> When attract mode
      is running, these events fire in random sequence and at random intervals.
      These can be used for effects that you want to fire randomly when
      attract mode is active.

   <li><b>PBYAttractWheelNext:</b> Attract mode is running and automatically
      switched to a new game

   <li><b>PBYEndGame:</b> The current running game has ended

   <li><b>PBYFlipperLeft:</b> The left flipper button (or whichever key
      is assigned as the Previous button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYFlipperRight:</b> The right flipper button (or whichever
      key is assigned as the Next button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYFlyer:</b> The Flyer command was selected, to display the
      current game's flyer as a popup window

   <li><b>PBYGameInfo:</b> The Information command was selected, to display
      the pop-up information box for the current game

   <li><b>PBYGameSelect:</b> A new game was selected

   <li><b>PBYHighScores:</b> The High Scores command was selected, to display
      the pop-up high score box for the current game

   <li><b>PBYInstructions:</b> The Instructions command was selected, to
       display the current game's instruction card as a popup window

   <li><b>PBYLaunchGame:</b> A game is being launched.  This fires at the
   start of the launch process, just after the user selects the launch
   command, before the new game program has been loaded.  Note that any
   device effects associated with this event might be cut off after a
   short time, because PinballY has to disconnect from DOF before the
   new game starts, to allow the game to take over the feedback devices.
   DOF turns off all devices when the program disconnects.

   <li><b>PBYMagnaRight:</b> The right MagnaSave button (or whichever key
       is assigned as the Next Page button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYMagnaLeft:</b> The left MagnaSave button (or whichever key
       is assigned as the Previous Page button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYMenuDown:</b> The user navigated to the next item in a menu

   <li><b>PBYMenuOpen:</b> A new menu was opened

   <li><b>PBYMenuSelect:</b> A command was selected in a menu (this usually
      means that the "Start" button, or whichever key is assigned as the
      Enter/Select command key, was pressed)

   <li><b>PBYMenuUp:</b> The user navigated to the previous item in a menu

   <li><b>PBYMenuQuit:</b> A menu was closed

   <li><b>PBYProgramStartup:</b> The program just started up

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaverStart:</b> Attract mode (the "screen saver" mode)
      is starting

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaverQuit:</b> Attract mode is exiting

   <li><b>PBYWheelNext:</b> The user navigated to the next game in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelNextPage:</b> The user navigated to the next "page" (the next
      alphabetical letter group) in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelPrev:</b> The user navigated to the previous game in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelPrevPage:</b> The user navigated to the previous "page" (the
      previous alphabetical letter group) in the wheel

</ul>

<h3>States</h3>
<p>
   In addition to events, PinballY has "states".  These differ from
   events only in that states are long-lasting.  An event fires
   briefly, usually triggering a quick event in DOF, such as flashing
   the flashers or firing a flipper solenoid.  A state turns on and
   stays on for an extended period.  States tell DOF the current
   context in the UI:  showing a game in the wheel interface, showing
   a menu, running the "attract mode" screen saver, and so on.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>PBYMenu:</b> A menu is being displayed

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaver:</b> Attract mode is active

   <li><b>PBYStartupVideo:</b> The startup video is playing

   <li><b>PBYWheel:</b> This is the default state, where the "wheel"
   interface is displayed with no menus or popups active

</ul>

<h3>Current ROM name</h3>
<p>
   In addition to the PBYxxx states, PinballY also
   turns on a named event with the same name as the ROM for the table
   currently selected in the wheel display.  For example,
   PinballY turns on the named effect <b>MM</b> when Medieval
   Madness is currently selected in the wheel.  This lets you trigger
   effects that depend on which table is selected.  The <b>@allrgb@</b>
   syntax described above uses this to select device colors according
   to the selected table, but you can also use it explicitly
   for individual effects.  The ROM names match the names in the
   Config Tool, which you can see listed on the Table Config page 
   (look for "Rom: XXX" near the top of the page).
</p>


<h3>Triggering DOF effects from Javascript</h3>
<p>
   PinballY lets you trigger DOF effects from Javascript using the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> methods
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#DOFPulse">DOFPulse()</a> and
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#DOFSet">DOFSet()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Those methods work in terms of DOF "named events", just like
   PinballY's own built-in DOF events.  With these methods, you
   can use any of the PinballY events listed above, but you can
   also define your own custom events using whatever names you
   choose.  DOF doesn't attach any significance of its own to
   event names; they're just arbitrary, user-defined labels that
   DOF uses to connect events fired by a program to rules defined
   in the DOF Config Tool.  So you're free to add your own new
   names alongside PinballY's custom events listed above.
</p>
<p>
   I'd recommend primarily using your own custom events with these
   methods.  You <i>can</i> use any of the pre-defined PinballY
   events, but remember that PinballY itself also fires those events
   when the associated UI actions occur, so there could be cases
   where you're working at cross purposes with the PinballY events.
   That won't make anything terrible happen, but it could make the
   final visible effects somewhat unpredictable.  For example, 
   PinballY might just happen to deactivate an event at the same
   moment that you activate it, preventing the effect you expected
   from appearing.
</p>
<p>
   Remember that the DOF Config Tool syntax for referring to a named
   event uses the <b>$</b> prefix.  So if you write something like
   <tt>mainWindow.DOFPulse("MyEvent")</tt> in Javascript, you'd
   refer to the event as <tt>$MyEvent</tt> in the Config Tool rules.
</p>


<h3>Why isn't there a "program exit" event?</h3>
<p>
   You might wonder why there's no event that fires when PinballY
   terminates, to match the <b>PBYProgramStartup</b> event that
   fires when the program first starts running.    The reason is
   that such an event would be useless, because DOF always resets
   everything when the host program exits.  Any effects that a
   "program exit" event triggered would be halted as soon as the
   DOF reset occurs, so there's no reason to bother programming
   such events - they'd just be lost anyway. 
</p>
<p>
   If you want to create program exit effects, a little Javascript
   scripting would be needed.  The key would be to intercept the
   <a href="Commands.html#Quit">command.Quit</a> command, via an
   event handler like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.Quit) {
        // place your special handling here
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   I can think of two approaches that would work, depending on the
   type of effect you wanted to create.  There are undoubtedly lots
   of other ways to do this as well, but here are my ideas:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Keep PinballY running while the DOF effect plays out, perhaps
   showing a custom "exiting" video in the main window while it's
   going on.  The "place your special handling here" code above would
   look something like this:
   <ul>
      <li>Prevent the standard handling (which would just immediately exit the program)
      <li>Use <a href="MainWindowObject.html#DOFPulse">mainWindow.DOFPulse()</a> to fire a custom "program exiting"
      DOF event of your own creation
      <li>Do something in the UI to let the user know that the program is shutting down,
      such as playing a custom video in the main window in a <a href="DrawingLayer.html">custom drawing layer</a>
      <li>Use <a href="SystemFunctions.html#setTimeout">setTimeout()</a> to set a timer for the duration of the DOF effect
      <li>When the timout fires, <i>actually</i> exit the program, via
      <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doCommand">mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit)</a>
   </ul>

   <li>Let PinballY exit as normal, but before it does, fire up
   a separate program that plays back your custom DOF effect.  For example, you
   could use LEDBlinky (a third-party program, available separately,
   that plays back LedWiz effects scripts).  The command.Quit handler
   wouldn't have to block the normal program exit; it would only
   have to launch the desired separate program.  See
   <a href="RunProgramExample.html">Running an External Program</a> for
   an example of how to launch a program from Javascript.
</ul>
