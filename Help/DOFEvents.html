<h1>DOF Events</h1>

<p>
   If DOF is installed on your system, PinballY generates
   DOF events to trigger effects from your feedback devices (such as
   solenoids and flasher lights).  This will fire flashers and other
   devices on certain events, such as when you switch between
   tables in the table list.
</p>
<p>
   DOF integration is automatic.
   To take advantage of it, just make sure that DOF is installed
   and that your .ini files from the
   <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>
   are up to date.  The PinballY definitions were added to the
   Config Tool database in late July 2018, so you'll need to generate
   and download fresh copies if your current .ini files are older
   than that.
</p>
<p>
   You can disable PinballY's DOF usage entirely via the
   <a href="DOFOptions.html">DOF Options</a> page in the Settings
   dialog.
</p>

<h2>DOF setup</h2>
<p>
   If you use a "cabinet config" file with DOF, it's important to create
   a DOF global config file for PinballY.  DOF uses a separate global
   config file for each program.  The DOF global config file for PinballY
   is called <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
</p>
<p>
   The easiest way to create the PinballY global config is to copy your
   existing global config for B2SServer:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open your main DOF install folder
   <li>Open the <b>Config</b> subfolder
   <li>Make a copy of <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b>
   <li>Rename the copy <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>
</ul>
<p>
   In the future, if you make any changes to any of your global config files,
   remember to make the same changes to your GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml file while
   you're at it.
</p>
<p>
   If you don't create a GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml file, DOF will just use its
   default settings for PinballY.  That's fine if you don't need any custom
   settings, but it's not fine if you need a cabinet config file, since the
   DOF default is that there is no cabinet config file.  The cabinet config
   file is important if you have devices that DOF can't discovery by scanning
   your system, particularly addressable LED strips.  If you have LED strips
   and they don't seem to work in PinballY, the problem might be a missing
   global config file for PinballY.
</p>
   

<h2>Customizing DOF effects</h2>
<p>
   You can customize all of PinballY's DOF effects via the
   <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The Config Tool's database  includes a predefined set of
   effects for PinballY, so you don't have to do anything to use
   the standard effects other than making sure your .ini files are
   up-to-date.  If you want to customize anything, though, the
   Config Tool lets you override any of the default effects with
   your own custom settings.
</p>
<p>
   Here's how you can access the PinballY settings in the Config Tool:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In your Web browser, open the <a href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/" target="_blank">DOF Config Tool</a>
   <li>Log in
   <li>Click <b>Table Configs</b> in the top navigation bar
   <li>Select <b>PinballY</b> from the Table Names drop list
</ul>

<p>
   All of the PinballY DOF effects are defined under this
   "PinballY" pseudo-table.  As far as DOF is concerned, PinballY is
   just another pinball table.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY's entries in the Config Tool follow the standard format
   defined by DOF.  That standard format is unfortunately rather obtuse
   and difficult to read, and it's beyond the scope of what we can explain here, but you can find
   documentation on it in the DOF user guide.  What we will give you is a
   list of the special event names and state names that PinballY generates.
</p>
<p>
   Note that all named effects in the Config Tool are specified with
   a <b>$</b> prefix, so remember to add that to the names in the lists below.
   For example, you'd write <b>$PBYWheelNext</b> in the Config Tool
   field if you want something to trigger on a "wheel next" event.
</p>
<p>
   <b>@allrgb@:</b>  There's one special bit of Config Tool syntax that's
   worth mentioning, because it's a special Config Tool feature that
   isn't part of DOF.  If you put <b>@allrgb@</b> in one of the toy
   fields, the Config Tool expands this to a list of the settings for
   that toy for all of the individual tables throughout the rest of
   the database.  This translates to showing the same colors on
   that device that would be shown if you were actually playing
   the game.  For example, putting <b>@allrgb@</b> in the "RGB
   Flippers" field makes the flipper buttons light up in the colors
   for whichever table is currently selected in the PinballY wheel
   display.  This only applies to RGB toys.  
</p>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
   Each time something DOF-worthy happens in the PinballY user
   interface, PinballY fires a named DOF event.  For example, when
   you press the Next button (usually the right flipper button) to
   switch to the next game, PinballY fires a <b>PBYWheelNext</b> event.
</p>
<p>
   Here's a list of the events that PinballY fires:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>PBYAttractA1</b> through <b>PBYAttractA5:</b> When attract mode is
      running, these events are fired in order (1 through 5) at 1-second
      intervals.  After reaching 5, the counter loops back to 1.  This can
      be used to create a series of events that runs on a 5-second loop.

   <li><b>PBYAttractB1</b> through <b>PBYAttractB60:</b> When attract
      mode is running, these events fire in order (1 through 60) at 1-second
      intervals, looping back to 1 after reaching the last event.  This can
      be used to create a series of events that runs on a 60-second loop.

   <li><b>PBYAttractR1</b> through <b>PBYAttractR5:</b> When attract mode
      is running, these events fire in random sequence and at random intervals.
      These can be used for effects that you want to fire randomly when
      attract mode is active.

   <li><b>PBYAttractWheelNext:</b> Attract mode is running and automatically
      switched to a new game

   <li><b>PBYEndGame:</b> The current running game has ended

   <li><b>PBYFlipperLeft:</b> The left flipper button (or whichever key
      is assigned as the Previous button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYFlipperRight:</b> The right flipper button (or whichever
      key is assigned as the Next button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYFlyer:</b> The Flyer command was selected, to display the
      current game's flyer as a popup window

   <li><b>PBYGameInfo:</b> The Information command was selected, to display
      the pop-up information box for the current game

   <li><b>PBYGameSelect:</b> A new game was selected

   <li><b>PBYHighScores:</b> The High Scores command was selected, to display
      the pop-up high score box for the current game

   <li><b>PBYInstructions:</b> The Instructions command was selected, to
       display the current game's instruction card as a popup window

   <li><b>PBYLaunchGame:</b> A game is being launched.  This fires at the
   start of the launch process, just after the user selects the launch
   command, before the new game program has been loaded.  Note that any
   device effects associated with this event might be cut off after a
   short time, because PinballY has to disconnect from DOF before the
   new game starts, to allow the game to take over the feedback devices.
   DOF turns off all devices when the program disconnects.

   <li><b>PBYMagnaRight:</b> The right MagnaSave button (or whichever key
       is assigned as the Next Page button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYMagnaLeft:</b> The left MagnaSave button (or whichever key
       is assigned as the Previous Page button) was pressed

   <li><b>PBYMenuDown:</b> The user navigated to the next item in a menu

   <li><b>PBYMenuOpen:</b> A new menu was opened

   <li><b>PBYMenuSelect:</b> A command was selected in a menu (this usually
      means that the "Start" button, or whichever key is assigned as the
      Enter/Select command key, was pressed)

   <li><b>PBYMenuUp:</b> The user navigated to the previous item in a menu

   <li><b>PBYQuit:</b> A menu was closed

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaverStart:</b> Attract mode (the "screen saver" mode)
      is starting

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaverQuit:</b> Attract mode is exiting

   <li><b>PBYWheelNext:</b> The user navigated to the next game in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelNextPage:</b> The user navigated to the next "page" (the next
      alphabetical letter group) in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelPrev:</b> The user navigated to the previous game in the wheel

   <li><b>PBYWheelPrevPage:</b> The user navigated to the previous "page" (the
      previous alphabetical letter group) in the wheel

</ul>

<h3>States</h3>
<p>
   In addition to events, PinballY has "states".  These differ from
   events only in that states are long-lasting.  An event fires
   briefly, usually triggering a quick event in DOF, such as flashing
   the flashers or firing a flipper solenoid.  A state turns on and
   stays on for an extended period.  States tell DOF the current
   context in the UI:  showing a game in the wheel interface, showing
   a menu, running the "attract mode" screen saver, and so on.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>PBYMenu:</b> A menu is being displayed

   <li><b>PBYScreenSaver:</b> Attract mode is active

   <li><b>PBYStartupVideo:</b> The startup video is playing

   <li><b>PBYWheel:</b> This is the default state, where the "wheel"
   interface is displayed with no menus or popups active

</ul>

<h3>Current ROM name</h3>

<p>
   In addition to the PBYxxx states, PinballY also
   turns on a named event with the same name as the ROM for the table
   currently selected in the wheel display.  For example,
   PinballY turns on the named effect <b>MM</b> when Medieval
   Madness is currently selected in the wheel.  This lets you trigger
   effects that depend on which table is selected.  The <b>@allrgb@</b>
   syntax described above uses this to select device colors according
   to the selected table, but you can also use it explicitly
   for individual effects.  The ROM names match the names in the
   Config Tool, which you can see listed on the Table Config page 
   (look for "Rom: XXX" near the top of the page).
