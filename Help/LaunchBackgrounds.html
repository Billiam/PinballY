<h1>Launch Backgrounds</h1>

<p>
   When you launch a game, PinballY normally displays a series of status
   messages ("Loading game", "Running", etc) in the main playfield window,
   drawn with a plain gray background.  If you prefer, you can replace
   the gray background with a custom image or video, simply by dropping
   an image or video file into one of the Media subfolders, as outlined
   below.
</p>

<h2>Using transparent images</h2>
<p>
   If you use a PNG image that's completely transparent as the custom
   background image, it'll have the effect of making PinballY continue
   to show the current table's background video or image while the game
   loads.  The gray background that PinballY shows by default is actually
   superimposed in front of the table background, so substituting a
   transparent image will allow the table background to remain visible
   through the loading process.  For your convenience, the PinballY
   distribution includes a simple transparent PNG file, called
   <b>Transparent.png</b>, located in the main Media folder.  To
   use it as a transparent background for the launch screen, you can
   simply copy this file into the Media &gt; Images folder and rename
   it as shown below.
</p>
<p>
   PNG images can also be partially
   transparent or translucent, so you can use this feature to superimpose
   images on top of the table background.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Double wheel image:</b>
   If you use a transparent launch background image,
   you'll probably notice that two copies of the wheel image are
   displayed during the launch, one on top of the other.
   One of these wheel images comes from
   the normal game wheel, and the other one comes from the "launch
   overlay" that PinballY displays in front of everything else.
   The overlay includes the wheel image for the
   game being launched along with a message giving the launch
   status ("Loading", etc).  Normally, when you're using the default
   opaque launch background, the regular game wheel gets covered
   up entirely by the opaque background, so you don't see the
   double image - you just see the one that's part of the overlay.
   But when you replace the default opaque background
   with complete transparency, the original wheel image shows through,
   so you see what appears to be a doubled-up wheel image.  The
   double image looks kind of ugly, so you'll almost certainly want to get rid of
   it.  To do so, you just need a little Javascript - you can find
   more details on this in the worked example <a href="SeamlessLoadingExample.html">"Seamless" Game Launch</a>,
   but here's the Javascript you need - just copy this into a file
   called <b>Main.js</b> in your PinballY <b>Scripts</b> folder:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    mainWindow.showWheel(false);
    mainWindow.setUnderlay("");
    ev.preventDefault();
});

mainWindow.on("launchoverlayhide", ev => {
    mainWindow.showWheel(true);
});
</div>

<h2>More than just background images</h2>
<p>
   Using a custom background image or video is an easy way to achieve
   some simple effects, but you can do much more extensive customizations
   to the launch screens using Javascript.  For example, instead of hiding
   the game wheel as suggested above, you could get rid of the launch
   overlay screen entirely, or you could change the way it looks by displaying
   your own custom text and/or graphics.  See <a href="SeamlessLoadingExample.html">Seamless
   Game Launch</a> in the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a>
   section for some examples.
</p>

<h2>Folder location</h2>
<p>
   Custom background images go in the <b>Images</b> folder within your
   main Media folder.
</p>
<p>
   Custom background videos go in the <b>Videos</b> folder within your
   main Media folder.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="Customizing.html#mediaFolder">Media folder location</a>
   for more on where that folder is located.
</p>
<p>
   A video file takes precedence.  If you supply both a custom video file
   and a custom image, the video will be displayed and the image will be
   ignored.
</p>

<h2>File names</h2>

<p>
   The filename for a custom launch video or image is always
   <b>Game Launch Background.<i>ext</i></b>, where <i>.ext</i>
   is one of the standard image file or video file extensions.
</p>

<h2>File types</h2>
<p>
   For image files, the extension can be any of the standard
   image file suffixes: .png, .apng, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif.
</p>
<p>
   For video files, the extension <i>.ext</i> can be any of the
   supported video file suffixes:  .mpg, .f4v, .mkv, .wmv, .m4v, or .avi.
