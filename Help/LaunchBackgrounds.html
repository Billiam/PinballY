<h1>Launch Backgrounds</h1>

<p>
   When you launch a game, PinballY normally displays a series of status
   messages ("Loading game", "Running", etc) in the main playfield window,
   drawn with a plain gray background.  If you prefer, you can replace
   the gray background with a custom image or video, simply by dropping
   an image or video file into one of the Media subfolders, as outlined
   below.
</p>
<p>
   If you use a PNG image that's completely transparent as the custom
   background image, it'll have the effect of making PinballY continue
   to show the current table's background video or image while the game
   loads.  The gray background that PinballY shows by default is actually
   superimposed in front of the table background, so substituting a
   transparent image will allow the table background to remain visible
   through the loading process.  For your convenience, the PinballY
   distribution includes a simple transparent PNG file, called
   <b>Transparent.png</b>, located in the main Media folder.  To
   use it as a transparent background for the launch screen, you can
   simply copy this file into the Media &gt; Images folder and rename
   it as shown below.
</p>
<p>
   PNG images can also be partially
   transparent or translucent, so you can use this feature to superimpose
   images on top of the table background.
</p>
<p>
   Using a custom background image or video is a simple way to achieve
   some simple effects, but you can do much more extensive customizations
   to the launch screens using Javascript.  See <a href="SeamlessLoadingExample.html">Seamless
   Game Launch</a> in the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a>
   section for some examples.
</p>

<h2>Folder location</h2>
<p>
   Custom background images go in the <b>Images</b> folder within your
   main Media folder.
</p>
<p>
   Custom background videos go in the <b>Videos</b> folder within your
   main Media folder.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="Customizing.html#mediaFolder">Media folder location</a>
   for more on where that folder is located.
</p>
<p>
   A video file takes precedence.  If you supply both a custom video file
   and a custom image, the video will be displayed and the image will be
   ignored.
</p>

<h2>File names</h2>

<p>
   The filename for a custom launch video or image is always
   <b>Game Launch Background.<i>ext</i></b>, where <i>.ext</i>
   is one of the standard image file or video file extensions.
</p>

<h2>File types</h2>
<p>
   For image files, the extension can be any of the standard
   image file suffixes: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif.
</p>
<p>
   For video files, the extension <i>.ext</i> can be any of the
   supported video file suffixes:  .mpg, .f4v, .mkv, .wmv, .m4v, or .avi.
