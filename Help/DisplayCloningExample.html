<h1>Display Cloning</h1>

<p>
   Most pin cabs have multiple monitors: one for the playfield, one for the
   backglass, possibly a third for the DMD score area.  Visual Pinball and
   some of the other pinball emulators can take full advantage of a
   multi-display layout, but some other software can't.  For example, some
   people run MAME arcade games or music jukebox software on their cabs.
   For some single-screen software, the most attractive way to run it on
   a multi-screen pin cab is to "clone" the desktop.  In "clone" mode,
   Windows simply displays the contents of the main monitor on all of
   the other monitors - it clones that one monitor across all of the
   displays.  In contrast, the mode you usually use with multiple monitors
   is "extend" mode, which allows each monitor to display an independent
   section of the desktop.
</p>
<p>
   The easiest way to switch between "extend" and "clone" mode is with
   a built-in Windows utility called DisplaySwitch.  DisplaySwitch can
   be run from a CMD (DOS box) window, so you can use it in Run Before
   and Run After command lines to invoke it before and after launching
   a game.  See <a href="SystemOptions.html">System Setup</a> for details
   on Run Before and Run After.
</p>
<p>
   So why not just do that?  Well, the standard DisplaySwitch utility has
   a really irritating feature, which is that it briefly displays its
   "control panel" UI every time it runs, even when you're using the
   command line format.
</p>
<p>
   This example shows how to accomplish the same kind of display
   mode switching <i>without</i> invoking the DisplaySwitch command,
   to make the change more seamless by eliminating the pointless
   control panel popup.
</p>

<h2>Windows API setup</h2>

<p>
   Windows has a system API that handles the display manipulations
   that the DisplaySwitch command performs.  We can call this through
   PinballY's <a href="DllImport.html">dllImport</a> mechanism, which
   lets us call just about any Windows API.
</p>
<p>
   This chapter isn't a tutorial for either the Windows API or
   the PinballY dllImport system, so we won't bore you with all of
   those details here.  But we do want to provide a complete
   example, so here's the code you need to "bind" the API calls
   we're going to make.  This code only needs to run once during
   the program session, so place it at the top level of the source
   file, outside of any functions.
</p>
<div class="code">
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", `
    LONG WINAPI SetDisplayConfig(
        UINT32 numPathArrayElements,
        void *pathArray,
        UINT32 numModeInfoArrayElements,
        void *modeInfoArray,
        UINT32 flags);
`);

const SDC_TOPOLOGY_CLONE  = 0x00000002;
const SDC_TOPOLOGY_EXTEND = 0x00000004;
const SDC_APPLY           = 0x00000080;
</div>

<h2>Cloning the display when a game is launched</h2>

<p>
   The goal is to switch the Windows desktop to "cloned" mode each
   time we launch a game that can't cope with the extended desktop.
   To do this, we listen for the <a href="LaunchEvent.html"><b>gamestarted</b></a> event, which fires
   when PinballY detects that a launched game has just started
   running.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gamestarted", ev => {
    if (isClonedSystem(ev.game.system)) {
        // switch the desktop to "clone" mode
        User32.SetDisplayConfig(0, null, 0, null, SDC_TOPOLOGY_CLONE | SDC_APPLY);
    }
});

function isClonedSystem(system)
{
    return system.displayName == "Jukebox";
}
</div>

<p>
   Note that "if" test at the start of the event listener: this checks
   to see if the game is one of the types that requires desktop cloning.
   We do this because we don't want to clone the
   desktop for <i>every</i> game launch; we only want to clone it when
   launching the particular types of games that look better in cloned
   mode.
</p>
<p>
   We wrote the test for "is this a system that requires cloning?"
   as a separate function, so that can easily do
   the same test when we get around to restoring the regular extended
   desktop, which we'll come to shortly.  For the purposes of this
   example, we're going to clone the desktop if the system name is
   "Jukebox".  "Jukebox" is just something
   we made up for this example; if you want to use this in your own
   system, change "Jukebox" to the name of the actual system you want
   to use cloning with.  If you want to clone the desktop for two
   or more different systems, just add OR conditions to the test.
</p>

<h2>Restoring "extend" mode when the game exits</h2>

<p>
   Switching back to "extend" mode is very similar.  We do this in another
   event listener, this time for the <a href="LaunchEvent.html"><b>gameover</b></a>
   event, which fires when PinballY has detected that the launched game
   process has exited.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gameover", ev => {
    if (isClonedSystem(ev.game.system)) {
        // switch the desktop back to "extend" mode
        User32.SetDisplayConfig(0, null, 0, null, SDC_TOPOLOGY_EXTEND | SDC_APPLY);
    }
});
</div>
