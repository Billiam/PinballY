<h1>ConfigChangeEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired whenever the configuration file is reloaded.
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
<ul>
   <li><b>configchange:</b> Fires after a configuration change is
   processed.  This event fires after the fact, so it's not cancelable.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>

<h2>Triggers and effects</h2>

<p>
   The system automatically reloads the configuration file any time the
   user makes changes in the Settings dialog.
</p>
<p>
   Reloading the configuration also requires reloading the game databases
   and game file lists, since changes to the settings can affect which
   files are included in the scans and which databases are loaded.
   Games that were previously loaded into the in-memory game list
   might be removed from memory as a result.  Any <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   objects or <a href="GameInfo.html#gameID">game ID</a> values that referred
   to such games will become invalid, so you could use this event
   to clear any global variables or other cached information you might
   be keeping on loaded games.
</p>
<p>
   Any table media files (playfield videos or images, etc) currently being
   displayed are also reloaded.
</p>
   


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  It has no additional
   properties beyond the standard set.
