<h1>Hide a Window During Play</h1>

<p>
   When you launch a game, PinballY normally leaves its windows open,
   allowing the launched game to bring its windows up in front of the
   PinballY windows.  The idea is to make the launch process a little
   smoother, visually, by keeping the PinballY windows in view until
   the game gets around to displaying its own windows.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, this ends up with the right windows on the screen,
   because Windows by default tries to place a newly launched application's
   windows in front of any windows that were already on the screen.
   So the PinballY backglass window remains visible until the game opens
   its window in the same area, at which point that window should be in
   front of the PinballY window, hiding it until the game ends.
</p>
<p>
   But this doesn't always work out so automatically.  The game you're
   launching might explicitly rearrange the window layering, defeating
   the automatic placement that Windows provides at launch, and possibly
   bringing the PinballY window back to the foreground.
   This can be particularly problematic with Visual Pinball, since
   what we think of as VP is really a collection of programs that
   work together: VP itself, the B2S backglass window program, 
   the VPinMAME ROM emulator, and possibly some third-party add-ons
   you've installed, such as Pinup Player or Freezy's dmd-extensions.
   When you have multiple programs launching together like that, the
   normal Windows rules ("latest program's windows go on top")
   don't always produce the right result, because the different components
   can open their windows in an unpredictable order.  What's more, the
   components sometimes try to "fix" this by explicitly rearranging
   the windows, and since they don't always coordinate perfectly on
   that, they can end up working at cross-purposes.
</p>
<p>
   There's one particular problem that a couple of people have mentioned,
   involving "two-screen" cabinets - meaning you have one screen for the
   playfield, and a second for the backglass, but <i>not</i> a third
   screen for the DMD.  In this setup, you might want to display both
   the backglass and DMD windows on the second monitor.  The snag
   is that if you have both windows on the same monitor, you probably
   want the DMD to stay in front of the backglass.  That's exactly
   the sort of situation that causes window layering conflicts among
   the VP components.   Now, keep in mind that we're
   talking about VP windows here (or, more precisely, a combination
   of VP, B2S, and VPinMAME windows).  None of these are controlled
   by PinballY, so there's not much PinballY can do about their
   layering.  However, the options that VP/B2S/VPinMAME offer for
   controlling the layering can cause a side effect that does involve
   a PinballY window: specifically, depending on how you have the VP/B2S/VPM
   options set up, you might end up with the PinballY backglass window
   staying in front of one of the game windows.
</p>
<p>
   The ideal solution would be to figure out the right set of VP/B2S/VPinMAME
   options to keep the window layering right on your system.  But this is
   notoriously twitchy, and VP/B2S/VPM only offer limited options for it,
   so some people can't find a working set of settings.  One thing that
   can help is getting the PinballY window entirely out of the mix, to
   reduce the number of variables.  A simple
   way to do this is to hide the PinballY window while a game is running.
   PinballY doesn't have a "checkbox" option for this, but
   you can do it through Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   The Javascript code to hide a window is pretty simple.
   You just need to make a call to the <a href="WindowObjects.html#showWindow">showWindow()</a>
   method of the <a href="BackglassWindow.html">backglassWindow</a> object.   
   For this situation, we want the window hiding to occur when a game is launched.
   So we're going to set up an event listener for the <a href="LaunchEvent.html"><b>gamestarted</b></a>
   event, which fires whenever a newly launched game starts running.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gamestarted", ev => { backglassWindow.showWindow(false); });
</div>

<p>
   We can also add Javascript code to re-show the PinballY window after the game
   is over.  It shouldn't actually be necessary to do this, because PinballY
   tries to restore its pre-launch window setup automatically when a game
   exits.  But for the sake of completeness (and in case the automatic
   un-hiding doesn't work for you for some reason), here's how we can
   restore the hidden window explicitly through Javascript:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gameover", ev => { backglassWindow.showWindow(true); });
</div>
<p>
   That's essentially the mirror image of how we hid the window in the first
   place: we set up a listener for the <b>gameover</b> event, which is the
   end-of-game counterpart of <b>gamestarted</b>, and we use that to make
   the backglass window visible again.
