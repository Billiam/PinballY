<h1>instCardWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>instCardWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the
   Instruction Card window in the user interface.   This is a window that can
   be optionally opened to show the apron instruction card for the currently
   selected game at any given time.  (This is a separate top-level window,
   <i>not</i> the separate pop-up graphic overlay that the user can bring
   up within the playfield or backglass window via the "Instructions" command.
   That's not a separate top-level window, just a graphic overlay on those
   other windows.)

   This object provides the <a href="WindowObjects.html#common">common
   window methods and properties</a>.  It doesn't currently have any additional
   properties or methods beyond the common set.
