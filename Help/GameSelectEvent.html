<h1>GameSelectEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired whenever the game selection in the
   wheel UI changes.  Selection changes can occur for a variety
   of reasons, including simple navigation commands (Next, Previous),
   selecting a new filter that doesn't match the previously selected
   game, batch capture processing, and attract mode updates.
   In addition to firing when switching from one game to another,
   the event fires when switching to or from an empty selection
   (that is, no game is selected because the wheel is empty).
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
<ul>
   <li><b>gameselect:</b> Fires when a new game is selected in
   the wheel UI.  This event fires after the fact, so it's not
   cancelable.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object.
</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  In addition, it
   has the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b>  The ID of the selected game, or undefined if no game
   is selected.  If a game is selected, the ID is an integer identifying
   the game, which you can pass to
   <a href="GameList.html#getGameInfo">gameList.getGameInfo</a>
   to retrieve the game's details.  It's possible for no game to be
   selected; this happens when the wheel is empty due to a filter
   that doesn't match any games or when the system simply doesn't
   find any installed games at all.

</ul>
