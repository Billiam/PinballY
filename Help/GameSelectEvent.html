<h1>GameSelectEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired whenever the game selection in the
   wheel UI changes.  Selection changes can occur for a variety
   of reasons, including simple navigation commands (Next, Previous),
   selecting a new filter that doesn't match the previously selected
   game, batch capture processing, and attract mode updates.
   In addition to firing when switching from one game to another,
   the event fires when switching to or from an empty selection
   (that is, no game is selected because the wheel is empty).
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
<ul>
   <li><b>gameselect:</b> Fires when a new game is selected in
   the wheel UI.  This event fires after the fact, so it's not
   cancelable.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object.
</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  In addition, it
   has the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>game:</b>  A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object
   identifying the newly selected game, or null if no game is selected.
   A null selection occurs when the wheel is completely empty, which
   can happen when the system can't find any games to load, or when
   a filter is activated that doesn't have any matching games.

</ul>
