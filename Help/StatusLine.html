<h1>StatusLine Class</h1>

<p>
   This is the base class for objects representing the status lines,
   which are the one-line text messages that appear near the bottom
   of the main playfield window.  Each status line rotates through a
   series of messages that can be customized by the user in the
   setting.
</p>
<p>
   There are three status lines in PinballY, each one represented
   by a system-defined Javascript object of class StatusLine.  Each
   one can be accessed through a property of the
   <b><a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>.statusLines</b>
   object, which is just a wrapper object containing the references
   to the individual status line objects in its properties.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>mainWindow.statusLines.upper:</b>  The upper line of the
   main status line, displayed in the playfield window during normal
   operation.

   <li><b>mainWindow.statusLines.lower:</b>  The lower line of the
   main status line.

   <li><b>mainWindow.statusLines.attract:</b>  The "attract mode"
   status line.  This is a single-line status message that replaces
   the normal upper/lower pair when attract mode is active.  This
   is only visible during attract mode.
</ul>

<p>
   You can use methods of these objects to access and change the
   messages displayed in the corresponding on-screen status areas.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   Each StatusLine object is an event target, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The StatusLine objects serve as the target for the following event types:
</p>
<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="StatusLine"></div>
   

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.add(<i>text</i>, <i>index</i>):</b>  Inserts a new
   message.  <i>text</i> is a string giving the new message text to add.
   This is the source text of the message, so it can contain 
   <a href="StatuslineOptions.html#substVars">substitution variables</a>
   that will be replaced with their current values each time the message is
   displayed on-screen.  <i>index</i> is an optional integer giving the
   position in the list at which to insert the new message.  0 inserts
   the new message before the first existing message, 1 inserts it
   before the existing second message, and so on.  If this is omitted
   or is out of range, the new message is inserted at the end of the
   current list.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.getCur():</b>  Returns the index of the item currently
   being displayed.  Returns -1 if there are no items in the list.
</p>
<p>
   The current message index can change <i>between</i> Javascript event handler
   invocations, but it can't change within a single event handler.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.getText():</b>  Returns an array representing all of the
   messages in the rotation list for this status line.  The array indices correspond
   to the index values used in the methods that operate on specific message
   entries (<b>add()</b>, <b>remove()</b>, etc).  Each element of the array is an object
  with these properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>text:</b>  A string giving the source text (before substitution variable
   replacements) of this message.
   <li><b>isTemp:</b> A boolean indicating if this is a temporary message scheduled
   via the <b>show()</b> method).  Temporary messages are shown
   once and then automatically removed from the rotation.
</ul>
<p>
   The array is just a snapshot of the system's internal message list, so 
   changes you make to the array or the message strings won't have any effect
   on what's displayed.  If you want to make changes to the live display
   list, use the various methods that operate on it (<b>setText()</b>,
   <b>add()</b>, etc).
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.id:</b>  A string identifying the status line:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li>"upper" for the upper status line
   <li>"lower" for the lower status line
   <li>"attract" for the attract-mode status line
</ul>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.remove(<i>index</i>):</b>  Deletes an entry
   from the status line's message list.  <i>index</i> is an integer
   giving the position of the item to remove: 0 is the first item,
   1 is the second item, and so on.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.setText(<i>index</i>, <i>text</i>):</b>  Changes the
   source text of the item selected by the integer <i>index</i> value
   to the string <i>text</i>.  The source text is the text before
   <a href="StatuslineOptions.html#substVars">substitution variables</a>
   are replaced, so this can contain variables that will be automatically
   replaced with current values each time the message is displayed.
</p>
<p>
   The <i>index</i> value can range from 0 to one less than the number of items
   in the status line's internal message list.  You can retrieve the current
   list with <b>getText()</b>.
</p>
<p>
   If the item is currently being displayed, the on-screen message will be
   immediately updated to reflect the new message.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>statusLine</i>.show(<i>text</i>):</b>  Displays a one-time-only
   message.  <i>text</i> is the source text to display, which can include
   <a href="StatuslineOptions.html#substVars">substitution variables</a>
   that will be replaced with their current values.  
</p>
<p>
   The message isn't displayed immediately, but rather is inserted into
   the message list just after the current message and after any temporary
   messages that already follow the current message.  This means that it
   will be displayed as soon as the current message's normal timer interval
   expires and the status line is ready to move on to the next message
   naturally.  The reason that the new message is inserted after
   any other temporary messages already queued up is that this preserves the
   ordering if you display a series of temporary messages, so that the
   messages are displayed in the same order in which they were added.
   The inserted message is marked as temporary, so that it's only displayed
   once, and then automatically deleted from the rotation.
</p>
<p>
   This function lets you display quick feedback
   for user actions in situations where a more intrusive message format
   (such as a pop-up message box) would be too heavy-weight.  Status
   line messages don't require any user acknowledgment and are
   visually unobtrusive, so they're good for cases where there's
   no particular need to alert the user to whatever information is
   being displayed, but where a user who's actively watching for the
   information might still want to see it.
