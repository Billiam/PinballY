<h1>Popups</h1>

<p>
   PinballY uses popup boxes to display messages and detailed information.
   Popup boxes are functionally similar to Windows dialog boxes, but they're
   visually styled to fit the arcade graphics environment, rather than appearing
   as separate windows.  They're also operable with the basic pin cab buttons
   rather than requiring a mouse.  Popups are mostly limited to information displays,
   as they don't have a full complement of input controls like Windows dialogs do.
   PinballY resorts to regular Windows dialogs for anything involving keyboard
   input or other complex input gestures.

<h2>Popup events</h2>

<p>
   When a popup opens or closes, the system fires <b>popupopen</b> and
   <b>popupclose</b> events (respectively).  See <a href="PopupEvent.html">PopupEvent</a>
   for details.
