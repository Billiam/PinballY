<h1>Popups</h1>

<p>
   PinballY uses popup boxes to display messages and detailed information.
   Popup boxes are functionally similar to Windows dialog boxes, but they're
   visually styled to fit the arcade graphics environment, rather than appearing
   as separate windows.  They're also operable with the basic pin cab buttons
   rather than requiring a mouse.  Popups are mostly limited to information displays,
   as they don't have a full complement of input controls like Windows dialogs do.
   PinballY resorts to regular Windows dialogs for anything involving keyboard
   input or other complex input gestures.
</p>

<h2>Popup events</h2>

<p>
   When a popup opens or closes, the system fires <b>popupopen</b> and
   <b>popupclose</b> events (respectively).  See <a href="PopupEvent.html">PopupEvent</a>
   for details.
</p>


<h2>System popups</h2>

<p>
   Here's a list of the system popup display types, with the ID strings
   reported in the .popupID property of the object returned from
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getUIMode">mainWindow.getUIMode()</a> while the
   popup is being displayed.
</p>

<ul>
   <li>"about box": the program about box
   <li>"batch capture preview": the batch capture preview dialog
   <li>"capture delay": the capture delay selection dialog box
   <li>"media list": the media list for the current game
   <li>"message": a message box, with an error, warning, or informational alert
   <li>"flyer": a game flyer
   <li>"game info": the detailed game information box
   <li>"high scores": the high scores box
   <li>"instructions": a game instruction card
   <li>"rate game": the game rating dialog (for entering a star rating)
   <li>"game audio volume": the game audio volume adjustment dialog (for adjusting the
   audio playback volume for the game's media)
</ul>

<h2>Custom popups</h2>

<p>
   The <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showPopup">mainWindow.showPopup()</a> method
   lets you create your own completely custom popup dialog, using the same basic
   display style as the system popups, but with your own custom contents.
</p>
<p>
   The argument to mainWindow.showPopup() is a descriptor object specifying the
   layout and contents of the popup.  The descriptor has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>backgroundColor:</b>  The background color for the whole popup area,
   as an HTML-style RGB (red/green/blue) value.  Specify this as a hex number with
   two hex digits each for the red, green, and blue components, each from 0x00 to
   0xFF.  For example, solid blue is 0x0000FF, and a 50% gray is 0x808080.  See any
   HTML color chart for example hues, and replace the "#" in the HTML notation with
   the Javascript "0x" prefix for a hex number.  The background color is ignored
   if a background image is specified.

   <li><b>backgroundImage:</b>  The name of a file (JPEG or PNG) to display as
   the background image.  If specified, this supersedes the background color and
   opacity, and it can help determine the sizing if you don't explicitly specify
   the width and height.
   
   <li><b>borderColor:</b>  The RGB color for the popup border, as an HTML-style
   0xRRGGBB value, just like the backgroundColor property.
   
   <li><b>borderWidth:</b>  The width in pixels of the border to draw around
   the popup.  If this is omitted, no border is shown.
   
   <li><b>draw:</b>  A Javascript function that draws the contents of the
   popup programmatically.  This lets you create complex layouts that mix text
   and graphics with precise positioning.  If you set the <b>draw</b> property
   to a function, the mainWindow.showPopup() method will call this function
   after setting up the initial popup area to let you fill in the display
   graphics.  See <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a> for
   details on how this works.
   <p>
      The <b>draw</b> function is optional.  You don't need to provide a
      drawing function if you just want to fill the popup with a fixed
      image, since you can do that by providing a <b>backgroundImage</b>
      property naming the image file you want to load.
   </p>
   
   <li><b>height:</b>  The height of the popup, as a percentage of the layout
   width of the window.  You can omit this if you want the system to use a
   suitable default or if you want to calculate the height dynamically based
   on the popup's contents.  See "default sizing" and "dynamic layout
   height" below.
   
   <li><b>id:</b>  A string identifying the popup.  This is an arbitrary
   identifier for your use in keeping track of the UI state; it's reported
   back to you in
   <a href="PopupEvent.html">PopupEvent</a> events and in the UI state
   returned from <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getUIMode">mainWindow.getUIMode()</a>.
   
   <li><b>opacity:</b>  The opacity of the background color, as a value from 0
   to 1, with 0 being fully transparent and 1 being fully opaque.  Most of the
   system popups use a dark background and an opacity of around 0.8 to 0.9,
   so that the playfield graphics remain faintly visible under the popup.  You
   can use the opacity to achieve a similar effect.  The opacity is ignored if
   a background image is supplied, since the image's own alpha channel information
   is used instead to determine its opacity.  If you want to use partial transparency
   with a background image, use the PNG format (since it supports full alpha channel
   information), and apply the desired transparency to the image itself with a
   photo editor program.
   
   <li><b>textColor:</b>  The initial text color for text drawn within the
   popup, as an HTML style 0xRRGGBB value, just like backgroundColor.
   Defaults to white (0xFFFFFF) if not specified.
   
   <li><b>width:</b>  The width of the popup, as a percentage of the layout
   <b>height</b> of the window.  Note that the window height is used as the basis
   here even though we're talking about the width of the popup, because this
   preserves the aspect ratio of the object as the window scales.  Internally,
   the system uses a normalized window aspect ratio of 16:9 (height:width),
   which is the standard aspect ratio of an HD or 4K monitor in portrait mode.
   So 100% of the standard layout width is 9/16 = .5625.
   
   <li><b>x:</b>  The horizontal offset of the popup, as a percentage of the
   main window's layout width.  If this is omitted, the popup is centered
   horizontally.
   
   <li><b>y:</b>  The vertical offset of the popup, as a percentage of the
   main window's layout height.  If this is omitted, PinballY automatically
   positions the popup according to the standard rules it uses for its own
   system popups, which are designed to make the popup look visually
   centered in the top portion of the screen above the wheel icons and
   status area at the bottom.
  
</ul>

<h3>Default sizing</h3>
<p>
   If you omit the width and/or height settings in the descriptor, the
   system figures a default size as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If a background image is specified, and both the width and height
      properties are omitted from the popup descriptor, the natural size of the
      background image is used, normalized to a notional 1920x1080 layout.
      (The window layout doesn't actually have to be 1920x1080; whatever
      the actual size is, the image is scaled as though it were being
      displayed in a 1920x1080 window.)

   <li>If a background image is specified, and <i>either</i> the width <i>or</i> height
   is specified, but not both, the dimension that's specified is applied,
   and the other dimension is chosen so that the natural aspect ratio
   of the image is preserved.

   <li>If there's no background image, and you omit the width, the system
   uses a default width of 80% of the layout width.

   <li>If there's no background image, and you omit the height, the system
   requires you to calculate a pixel height for the content area and return
   it from the <b>draw</b> function you provide in the popup descriptor.
   An error is thrown if you don't supply a <b>draw</b> function or it
   doesn't return a height value.  See "dynamic layout height" below.
</ul>

<a name="dynamicLayoutHeight"></a>
<h3>Dynamic layout height</h3>
<p>
   In some cases, you might want to adjust your popup's overall display
   height according to its contents, so that it's just tall enough to
   display the specific contents you draw into the popup.  The required
   height might not be predictable in advance, so the popup system
   gives you a way to calculate the height from your Javascript code,
   on the fly as you do the drawing.  This lets you determine precisely
   the needed height needed to contain the actual contents you display.
</p>
<p>   
   To use a dynamically calculated height, you have to leave all of
   the "pre-calculated" height elements in the popup descriptor blank.
   Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In the popup descriptor, specify the desired width via the
   <b>width</b> property, but omit the <b>height</b> property.

   <li>Don't specify a <b>backgroundImage</b> property.  Doing so
   implicitly sets a pre-calculated height based on the image's
   natural size.  If you need to display
   a background image with a flexible-height popup, draw it
   within your <b>draw</b> function using the drawing context's
   drawImage() method.

   <li>You must, of course, provide a custom drawing function
   via the <b>draw</b> property of the popup descriptor.

   <li>In your custom drawing function, keep track of the layout
   sizes of the items you're displaying.  You can use the
   drawing context's measureText() function to figure the size
   of a text item, for example.

   <li>Return the final computed height as the return value
   from your custom drawing function.
</ul>

<p>
   The system can tell that it has to use the "dynamic" method to
   determine the height when it sees that you haven't provided any
   way for it to pre-calculate the height, either from an explicit
   <b>height</b> property or from an implied height based on a
   <b>backgroundImage</b> property.
</p>
<p>
   When the dynamic height method is required, the system
   calls your drawing function <i>twice</i>.  The
   first time, the call is only to figure out the height, and doesn't
   do any actual on-screen drawing.  There are three important implications
   of this two-pass process:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, the actual layout height isn't
   yet known on the first call, since the whole point of the first
   call is to determine that information.  So if you call getSize()
   on the drawing context, the height returned will be invalid.

   <li>Second, any drawing you do on this first pass is ignored and
   won't actually appear on-screen, so it's okay if the exact
   drawing positions of objects are wrong on this first pass.
   For example, if you want to align something with the bottom
   of the popup, you won't be able to get that position right on
   the first pass because the overall popup height won't be known
   at that point.  The actual drawing occurs on the second pass,
   at which point the final height is known, so your vertical
   position calculations will be valid.

   <li>Third, because the function will be called twice, it's
   important that you don't do anything "global" within the
   function.  Anything you do will happen twice, so you don't
   want to do anything that triggers a side effect that the
   user can see (for example, showing an alert box), and you
   don't want to do anything that changes the values of global
   variables.
</ul>

<h3>Calculating the height in the drawing function</h3>
<p>
   If you use the "dynamic layout height" procedure described
   above, your custom drawing function must return a value indicating
   the desired pixel height for the popup box.  This is necessary if
   you don't specify a height for the popup in the popup descriptor
   and you don't supply a background image, since that doesn't give
   the system any way to figure the required height on its own.
</p>
<p>
   To calculate the required height, you should keep
   track of the positions and heights of the objects you draw, and
   use that to calculate the overall height needed for the contents.
   Return the result as the return value from the function.
</p>
<p>
   The system ignores the returned height value if you provide a
   height explicitly in the original popup descriptor object, or
   if you specify a background image in the popup descriptor.  In
   either case, the pre-determined height supersedes the custom draw
   function's calculated height.
