<h1>Exit the Game by a Long Key Press</h1>

<p>
   The usual way of exiting a game and returning to PinballY
   is to press the "Exit" button
   on your cabinet.  PinballY lets you map the Exit function to any
   keyboard key or joystick button, so as long as you have a dedicated
   button on your cab labeled Exit, you can assign it in PinballY
   as the "end game" button.
</p>
<p>
   But what if your cab doesn't have a separate Exit button?  Some
   cab builders prefer a very minimal set of buttons, to better
   replicate the spare look of a real pinball machine.
</p>
<p>
   There are a few ways to operate a cab without an Exit button.
   The most obvious is to <i>actually</i> include an Exit button,
   just putting it somewhere hidden, like on the bottom of the
   cabinet.  Another way is to use special features in your key
   encoder to simulate extra buttons; for example, some key
   encoders let you create "Shift" buttons that give all of
   your other buttons a second meaning.  So you could make your
   Start button do double duty as both the Start and Exit button,
   by assigning Exit to its shifted function.
</p>
<p>
   This script offers another alternative: it turns a "long press"
   on one of your other buttons into a simulated Exit button press.
   A "long press" simply means that you press and hold the button
   for a few seconds.  The Start button seems to me to be the obvious
   choice, since there's a nice symmetry to pressing it to start a game,
   and pressing it again (with a long hold) to exit the game.  It
   also happens to work well with most tables, since I don't think
   I've seen any tables where a long press on the start button had
   any special meaning within the table itself.
</p>

<h2>Key event listeners and timers</h2>
<p>
   Our approach to implementing the long press is pretty simple, especially
   if you've read any of the other worked examples that involve keyboard
   events.  We really just need three elements:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A key event listener that fires when you <b>press</b> the button
   that we're going to use for the long press.  This listener will start
   a timer each time you press the button; when the timer expires, it'll
   fire a Kill Game command to terminate the running game and return to
   PinballY, as though you had pressed a physical Exit button on the
   cabinet.

   <li>Another key event listener that fires when you <b>release</b> the
   button.  This simply cancels the timer, if it's running, so that
   short presses (below the desired hold interval) don't also exit the
   running game.

   <li>The timer function, which simply fires the Kill Game command.
   The timer function will only execute when the timer runs to completion,
   which will only happen when the player presses and holds the button
   for longer than the timeout interval.
</ul>

<h3>The script</h3>

<p>
   Here's the script that puts this all together.  To make it easier to
   adapt to different situations, we defined the button that triggers
   the command and the long-press hold time with constants at the top.
   Just change those constants to customize either element.
</p>

<div class="code">
// The key code to use for the long press.  Set this to one of the
// standard Web browser KeyboardEvent key codes: see, for example,
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code/code_values
const StartButtonCode = "Digit1";

// Long key press time.  This is the time in milliseconds for the long
// press.  Hold down the key for this long to exit the game.
const LongPressTime = 3000;

// When a key timer is running, we remember it here
let timer = undefined;

// When the start button is pressed, start a timer.  When the timer
// expires, send a KILL GAME command to the main window, to simulate
// the effect of the EXIT button.
mainWindow.on("keydown keybgdown", ev => {
    if (!ev.repeat && ev.code == StartButtonCode && mainWindow.getUIMode().runMode) {
        cancelTimer();
        timer = setTimeout(function() {
            mainWindow.doCommand(command.KillGame);
            timer = undefined;
        }, LongPressTime);
    }
});

// If the start button is released while our long-press timer is
// running, cancel the timer.
mainWindow.on("keyup keybgup", ev => {
    if (ev.code == StartButtonCode)
        cancelTimer();
});

// Cancel the timer, if it's running.
function cancelTimer()
{
    if (timer) {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = undefined;
    }
}
