<h1>New System Setup</h1>

<p>
   To a first approximation, adding a new pinball player system to PinballY
   is straightforward:  bring up the <a href="OptionSettings.html">Option Settings</a>
   dialog, navigate to the <b>Systems</b> section in the list on the left,
   click the <b>Add a new system</b> button to create a blank options page
   for a new system, and then fill in the details on the new system page.
   The trick is in figuring out those "details".
</p>
<p>
   Before you set about re-inventing the wheel, please check the list of
   <a href="SystemOptions.html#standardRecipes">Recipes for common systems</a>
   in the main <a href="SystemOptions.html">System Options</a> section.
   Most of the pinball game systems that people use on pin cabs are
   listed there.  If the system you're looking to add isn't there, though,
   the information below should help.  If you do have to add a brand new system,
   please send me the details once you have it working reliably, and I'll
   be happy to add it to the common recipe list.
</p>

<h2>What <i>not</i> to do</h2>

<p>
   You shouldn't have to manually edit any of the XML "Database" files
   or PinballY's internal ".csv" game list file.  PinballY will take
   care of editing those files automatically if you follow the
   procedures below.  It's safer to let PinballY maintain those files
   instead of editing them manually, because they're very picky about
   getting the syntax exactly right.
</p>


<h2>Finding the new system's games</h2>

<p>
   The first potentially tricky part of setting up a new system is: how
   do you get PinballY to recognize the new system's games and add them
   to the "wheel" UI that shows all of your available games?
</p>
<p>
   To understand how to accomplish this, we have to understand what
   PinballY thinks of as a "game".  To PinballY, every game is represented by
   a file on your hard disk that it calls a "table file".  In most
   cases, <i>this isn't a file you have to create</i> - it's a file
   that you'll already have, and that PinballY finds.
</p>
<p>
   The concept of a "table file" comes from the design of the most
   popular free programs, Visual Pinball and Future Pinball.
   Those programs both use a file on your hard disk to store everything
   about a particular game.  In the case of VP, these files have names
   ending with <b>.vpx</b> (for version 10 of VP, also known as VPX)
   and <b>.vpt</b> (for VP versions 9 and earlier).  Future Pinball
   uses a suffix of <b>.fpt</b> for its table files.
   For example, when you download a copy of <i>Funhouse</i> for Visual Pinball,
   it'll consist of a file called something like <b>Funhouse_v3.vpx</b>.
   That's what PinballY calls the "table file" - that main file that
   you open with Visual Pinball when you want to edit or play that game.
</p>
<p>
   Games designed for Visual Pinball and other systems might <i>also</i> have
   a bunch of other associated files, such as the <b>.directb2s</b>
   files that many VP games use for backglass displays, and the ROM
   <b>.zip</b> files that VPinMAME loads when playing a game.  PinballY
   doesn't really care about those; it just cares about that main
   file for each game that we call the table file.
</p>
<p>
   The table file is what PinballY uses to detect the existence of a
   game.  This works great for Visual Pinball and similar systems,
   because it means that PinballY can find all of your installed
   games almost by magic, without any work on your part to slog
   through your table folders and manually enter all of the games.
   For any system like VP that uses table files, you only have to
   provide two pieces of information in the system settings dialog,
   and PinballY will automatically find all of your games:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Table folder</b>: the folder location where all of your games for that system are installed
   <li><b>Table extension</b>: the filename suffix for all of the table files for the system
</ul>
<p>
   Each time you run PinballY, it scans the Table Folder for each system
   and looks for all files matching the system's filename extension.
   For each file it finds, it automatically adds an entry for that
   game to the wheel UI.  As a result, there's no need to manually
   create a list of your games anywhere.  PinballY just figures it
   out automatically by scanning for matching files.
</p>

<h3>Table files for systems that don't use them</h3>
<p>
   The snag with the table file scheme is that some pinball game
   systems - particularly some of the commercial games - don't
   use table files at all.  Some game systems have all of the games
   built in to the program, or stored online, or something else entirely.
</p>
<p>
   So how are you supposed to tell PinballY what tables exist for a system that doesn't
   have any table files?
</p>
<p>
   The answer is that you <i>still</i> need the table files.  But in
   this case, they don't need to be "real" table files that actually
   came with the game.  They can be "dummy" files that you create
   manually:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create a folder that will hold your dummy files.  This folder
   can be located anywhere you want, such as in the PinballY program
   folder or in your Windows Documents folder.  It doesn't matter.
   Give it a recognizable name related to the product name of the
   game, so that you can remember what it's for.  Enter this folder
   location in the <b>Table Folder</b> box in the system's page
   in the PinballY settings dialog.

   <li>Make up a filename suffix for the dummy files.  Again, this
   can be any suffix you want.  Let's use <b>.game</b> for the
   sake of this example.  Enter this suffix in the <b>Table Extension</b>
   box in the settings dialog, <i>including</i> the leading "dot".

   <li>Go to the dummy file folder you created.  For each of the
   system's games that you want to include in PinballY, create an
   empty text file for the game.  Be sure to use the filename
   suffix you selected above for each file.  So for a game
   called <i>Funhouse</i>, you might create a file called
   <b>Funhouse.game</b>.
   <p>Again, these are just dummy files. All that matters
      is that the <i>exist</i> and have the right folder
      location and right filename suffix, so that PinballY
      can find them during its folder scans.  PinballY
      won't need to look inside them,  nor will the game, so they just can be empty.
      Or you use them to record notes on the game, for example.</p>

   <li>The next time you run PinballY, you should see a wheel entry
   appear for each game for which you create a dummy .game file.
   You can now complete setup for each game as normal using the
   Game Setup menu.  Use the <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Edit Game Details</a>
   command to set up the metadata, and use the <a href="MediaCapture.html">Media Capture</a>
   commands to create table videos, backglass videos, and other media.
</ul>


<h2>Database files and media files</h2>

<p>
   In addition to the basic "table file" that in effect declares the
   existence of a game to PinballY, the system also keeps several other
   pieces of information about each game:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A "database" entry with the game's metadata (title, year, manufacturer, etc)
   <li>"Media files" for the game (table video, backglass image, etc)
</ul>
<p>
   To set up a new system, you actually don't have to think too much
   about these, because PinballY will take care of them automatically
   for the most part.  The system will select default locations for the
   database and media files based on the name of the system that you
   enter in the new system's settings page when you first create it.
   PinballY will also automatically create the database files
   as needed when you use the <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Edit Game Details</a>
   dialog to set up an individual game that's associated with the new system,
   and it'll automatically create media files for the system's games
   when you use the <a href="MediaCapture.html">Media Capture</a> commands.
</p>
<p>
   So, in most cases, you can just leave the <b>Database folder</b>
   and <b>Media folder</b> entries blank when setting up a new system,
   and let PinballY select defaults based on the system name that
   you enter.  You should only enter values in these boxes if you
   have some reason to override the defaults.  See
   <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a> for more
   details on how these locations work.
</p>

<h2>Special settings for Steam games (and some others)</h2>
<p>
   Many of the commercial pinball games these days are based on Steam.
   Steam games use a two-step launch process that requires some special
   attention in the PinballY setup.  Some other game systems, including
   Future Pinball with the BAM extension, use the same approach, and
   need the same sort of special handling in PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   "Two-stage launch" means that the game program starts up with not
   one but two .EXE program launches in Windows.  You start the game by
   launching the Steam executable, Steam.exe, with a parameter telling
   Steam which actual game you're trying to start.  Steam then fires up
   a second process using the actual .EXE program that contains the
   game's programming.  After Steam starts up the real game program,
   Steam exits, leaving the game program running.
</p>
<p>
   This requires some special setup in PinballY because of the way
   PinballY monitors the launched game to determine when it quits.
   Normally, PinballY assumes that the program you tell it to launch
   is the actual game program.  So to figure out when the game is
   over, PinballY monitors that launched program process, and assumes
   that the game has ended when the program exits.  This doesn't work
   for a two-stage launch process, however, because the program that
   PinballY launches initially doesn't keep running for long - it
   only runs long enough to start the second phase, and then exits.
   With PinballY's default assumption that the launched program is
   the game itself, this makes PinballY take control again prematurely,
   since it thinks the game is done as soon as that first "launcher"
   stage exits.
</p>
<p>
   This two-stage arrangement is fairly common, so PinballY has
   special handling for it.  But PinballY can't figure out on its
   own when the special handling is needed; you have to say so
   explicitly.  The way you do this is via the <b>Process Name</b>
   box in the settings page for the system in the PinballY
   options dialog.
</p>
<p>
   For any Steam-based game, the standard recipe for setting up the
   two-stage launch is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Set the <b>System class</b> to <b>Steam</b>
   <li>Set the <b>Program EXE</b> to <b>[STEAM]</b> (enter those square bracket literally)

   <li>Set the <b>Parameters</b> to <b>-applaunch 123456</b>, replacing the number with the
   appropriate Steam identification number for the particular game.  Unfortunately, I don't know of
   any master list of these special numbers; it's something you have to "know" for each
   game.  It's usually pretty easy to find them on gamer forums, if you search for
   the name of the game plus "applaunch".

   <li>Depending on the game, you might also have to add some more magic words to the
   <b>Parameters</b> line, such as to select game options or to tell it which pinball
   table to launch.  For FX3, for example, you have to add <b>"[TABLEFILEBASE]"</b>
   to the string to tell FX3 which table you want to play, because FX3 has many
   tables in one program .EXE file.  Again, the options are peculiar to each
   game, so I can't give you a simple recipe here.  This is another bit of magic
   that you have to look up somewhere on the Internet, your best bet being gamer
   forums where other people have already figured out the right keywords.

   <li>Set <b>Process Name</b> to the "final" executable for the game.  Yet again,
   this is special to each game, so you just have to "know" somehow.  One way is
   to run the game from the desktop, and <i>while it's running</i>, use the Windows
   Task Manager to inspect the list of active processes and identify the .EXE file
   for the one that represents the running game.
</ul>
