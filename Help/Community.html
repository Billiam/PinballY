   Here are some places on the Web where you can connect with
   other PinballY people.

<ul>
   <li><a href="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=29">The Virtual Pinball Cabinets forum on vpforums</a>.
   This is a busy forum for everything related to building pin cabs, so it's a good fit for PinballY
   topics, given that PinballY is designed especially for pin cabs.  I'm usually pretty active here, so
   it's a good place to reach me.

   <li><a href="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showtopic=40679">My "Call for testing" thread</a> in the pin cabs
   forum above.  This is where I originally announced the program, and it became the program's de facto support thread
   for questions and bug reports.  It's ridiculously lengthy at this point, but I monitor it and try to follow
   up when appropriate, so it's a good place to post questions.

   <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/781499215682063/">PinballY group on Facebook</a>, created
   by cherlihy71.

   <li><a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/issues/">PinballY issues page on github</a>.  This is 
   the github bug tracker for the project.  It can be used for bug reports and enhancement requests.
   I monitor this regularly.
</ul>

   Please pass along any other links that I should add here!
