<h1>NativePointer Objects</h1>

<p>
   A NativePointer object represents a memory pointer value,
   for use with external DLL functions through the
   <a href="DllImport.html">DLL importer</a> system.  These
   objects are automatically created by the system when
   needed.
</p>
<p>
   The reason we need our own "native pointer" type is
   that pointers are used widely in the Windows APIs, and
   in many other DLLs, but Javascript doesn't have any
   concept of a pointer or memory address.  Pointers are
   tied to the structure of physical memory, and while
   Javascript does ultimately use memory just like any other
   programming system, it hides all of the details of
   how that memory is laid out from programs written
   in the language.  If we want to be able to access 
   external functions that work in terms of pointers,
   we have to add something to Javascript that's capable
   of representing a pointer value.  That's what
   NativePointer does.
</p>
<p>
   A NativePointer object isn't quite the same thing as
   a C pointer.  A NativePointer is actually a Javascript object,
   not some new datatype.  A NativePointer object
   <i>contains</i> a native memory pointer value as a
   hidden internal property.  As such, Javascript code can
   work with a NativePointer object just like any other object,
   and the DLL importer can access the contained memory
   pointer value when calling between Javascript and
   native code.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the memory address it contains, a
   NativePointer stores the C datatype of the underlying
   value.  This allows for type checking when using the
   pointer and accessing the referenced memory, to help
   avoid common errors arising from mixing pointers to
   unlike types.
</p>
 
<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   You usually won't need to create NativePointer objects manually.
   The DLL importer usually creates these for you automatically
   when pointer values are passed to Javascript from
   native DLL code.  For example, if you call a function that returns
   a pointer value as its result, the importer creates a NativePointer
   object to represent the returned pointer value.
</p>
<p>
   You can also get a pointer to a native object using
   NativeObject.addressOf(<i>nativeObject</i>).  See
   <a href="NativeObject.html">NativeObject</a>.
</p>
<p>
   If you have some unusual situation that requires creating
   a pointer to a specific memory address that isn't already
   in the form of a pointer, you can use NativePointer.fromNumber()
   to create a pointer to a numeric address:
</p>
<div class="code">
// create a pointer to physical memory address 0x12345678
let p = NativePointer.fromNumber(0x12345678);
</div>

<p>
   It should go without saying that this is inherently dangerous,
   in the sense that it can crash the program if used improperly.
   Use it only when you know what you're doing and have a good reason
   for it.
</p>


<h2>Pointer conversions and type checking</h2>

<p>
   A pointer always points to some other type.  If you get a pointer
   from the DLL importer, such as from the return value from a
   native function, or an element of a native struct, the pointer
   internally records the type of the source object.  The
   NativePointer class uses this to ensure that you only use
   the pointer value to reference the right kind of data.
   In particular, you can only assign a NativePointer value
   to a native data object if the pointer has a compatible type.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("struct Pointers { int *pInt; float *pFloat; }");
let p = dllImport.create("struct Pointers");
let i = dllImport.create("int");
p.pInt = NativePointer.addressOf(i);   // valid - same pointer type
p.pFloat = NativePointer.addressOf(i); // INVALID - different pointer type
</div>

<p>
   This type checking is intended to avoid errors that could crash
   the program.  If you pass any of these objects to native code in
   a DLL, the native code won't have any of the information that
   Javascript has about the value types; native code just sees
   the raw bytes, and blindly assumes that the bytes are laid out
   correctly according to the declared types.  Many types of
   application crashes are caused by data values that got scrambled
   because someone wasn't careful about using the right pointer
   types.
</p>
<p>
   However, native APIs sometimes force you to get into the details
   of how the bytes are laid out, so in some cases it's necessary 
   to forcibly convert one pointer type to another.  NativePointer
   has a way to do this: the <i>pointer</i>.to() method.
   This lets you do the equivalent of a C "type cast", forcing the
   pointer to a different type.
</p>
<p>
<div class="code">
p.pFloat = NativePointer.addressOf(i).to("float*");
</div>
<p>
   Needless to say, you should only use this type of forced
   pointer conversion when the underlying memory really is laid
   out in the way that you're asserting it to be.  Don't make
   the newbie C programmer mistake of using a type cast to
   "shut up the compiler" (that is, to override a system
   safeguard without fully understand the reason for the
   safeguard).  Be sure you know what you're doing
   when you mess with the hardware bytes like this.
</p>


<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.at:</b>  Returns a <a href="NativeObject.html">NativeObject</a>
   that represents the native data that the physical memory pointer
   within the NativePointer object <i>points to</i>.  This
   new Javascript object represents the underlying native
   data value just as though it had come from native code
   directly, so you can access the underlying native value
   by using the .value property or, in the case of a
   struct type, the named elements of the struct.
</p>
<p>
   <i>pointer</i>.at is analogous to the *<i>pointer</i> operator in C.
</p>

<div class="code">
// let's define a function returning a pointer to a struct
dllImport.define("struct foo { int a; int b; }");
let { func } = dllImport.bind("MyDll.dll", "struct foo *func()");

// calling the function returns a NativePointer pointing to a 'foo' struct
let p = func();

// 'at' gives us structure itself
let s = p.at;

// now we can access the struct's fields
s.a = 123;
s.b = 456;

// we could also do this more directly
p.at.a = 789;

// with a pointer to a simple type, we use .value instead of a struct field
let { func2 } = dllImport.bind("MyDll.dll", "int *func2()");
p = func2();
p.at.value = 7;
</div>

<p>
   <b>NativePointer.fromNumber(<i>number</i>):</b>  Creates and
   returns a new void* pointer that references the given memory
   address.
</p>
<p>
   A void* pointer serves as a wildcard pointer that you can
   convert to any other pointer type.  You can't use a void*
   pointer by itself to access the memory at the referenced
   location, because "void" means that we haven't declared
   what sort of data is at the referenced location.  A void
   pointer is just a raw memory address.  What you <i>can</i>
   do with a void* pointer is assign it freely to any other
   pointer type:
</p>
<div class="code">
// create a pointer to int, initially a null pointer (pointing nowhere)
let pInt = dllImport.create("int*");

// now point it to a location we got from some external source
pInt.value = NativePointer.fromNumber(0x12345678);

// read the value at that address
let i = pInt.at.value;
</div>
<p>
   Caution!  fromNumber() is obviously "bare metal" programming
   that bypasses the normal Javascript type checking and memory
   management.  Even C programmers consider this sort of
   thing bad form.  But there are some contexts
   where you really need to do it, which is why we provide the
   capability.  Some APIs make this sort of unstructured pointer
   manipulation unavoidable.  But you should only use it when
   you're really sure you know what you're doing, and you're
   equally sure there isn't a more type-safe approach.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.isNull:</b>  Returns true if the underlying
   native pointer is a null pointer, false if not.  Null pointers
   are often used in native code to represent special cases, such
   as missing or default values, or unused "out" parameters.  They're
   somewhat analogous to the Javascript <b>null</b> value semantically,
   but of course a native null pointer has a specific native
   representation.  A null pointer on current Windows platforms
   <i>happens</i> to be represented as hardware address zero, so
   toNumber() will return 0 for a null pointer, but it's bad practice
   to assume this will always be true.  It could change on future
   platforms, because the underlying representation of a pointer
   is hardware-specific.  isNull() is the proper way
   to test for a null pointer, since it uses the appropriate
   hardware representation for the local machine.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.to(<i>typeName</i>):</b> Returns a new
   NativePointer representing the same pointer value, but with
   its type signature changed to <i>typeName</i>.  This lets you
   override the normal type checking that prevents mixing unlike
   pointer types.  Needless to say, that's dangerous, so only
   use it when (a) it's necessary and (b) you know what you're doing.
</p>
<div class="code">
let pInt = dllImport.create("int*");
let pFloat = dllImport.create("float*");

pInt.value = pFloat.value;             // INVALID - incompatible type
pInt.value = pFloat.value.to("int*");  // forcibly convert the type
</div>
<p>
   If the new type name is a numeric type rather than a pointer
   type, the bits making up the pointer's address are reinterpreted
   as that numeric type, and a NativeObject is returned instead of
   a NativePointer.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toArray(<i>numberOfElements</i>):</b> Returns
   a new <a href="NativeObject.html">NativeObject</a> 
   representing a native array of the same type that the pointer
   refers to, at the same native memory location, with the given
   number of elements.
</p>
<p>
   This creates an array <b>view</b> of the same data that the
   pointer refers to.  This routine <b>doesn't</b> allocate
   new memory or increase the size of the memory area that
   the pointer points to.  You should only use it when you
   know that the memory area at the pointer <i>already</i>
   has the number of elements that you're asking to view.
</p>
<p>
   This method will seem bizarre if you're used to
   Javascript.  But it's a very common thing to do in C.
   In C, pointers and arrays are closely related.  A C
   array is a block of contiguous items of the same type,
   arranged in memory one after the other.  A variable
   that contains an array of type <i>T</i> therefore has
   exactly the same representation as a pointer to <i>T</i>.
   For that reason, APIs based on C syntax
   and C idioms will sometimes (often, in fact) use a
   pointer parameter when they <i>really</i> mean an array.
   In many cases, this
   is used to refer to an array with a size that will vary
   at run-time, meaning it can't be predicted when the
   function interface is declared.  This function lets
   you do the same kind of pointer/array aliasing in Javascript.
   It's up to you to figure out how big the actual array
   in memory is.  This is often indicated in another
   parameter or another struct member, but there's no
   particular convention for it, so you'll just have to
   figure it out on a case-by-case basis when it arises.
   If you're using a Windows API, the documentation
   should explain how the array size can be determined.
   Once you know the size of the live array data, this method lets
   you exchange your pointer variable for an array
   variable that lets you access all of the elements,
   using the normal array[index] syntax.
</p>
<p>
   The reverse case is also common
   in C-style APIs, where you have an array object, and
   you want to treat it as a pointer to the element type,
   for storing in a struct or passing as a parameter.
   You can use NativeObject.addressOf() for that, passing
   in a NativeObject that represents a native array type.
   That will return a pointer to the array's first element.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toArrayBuffer():</b>  Returns a Javascript
   ArrayBuffer object that provides byte access to the native
   memory that the pointer refers to.  The buffer is the same
   size in bytes as the type that the pointer refers to.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toNumber():</b>  Returns the memory address
   contained in the pointer as a Javascript number value.  Note
   that on 64-bit Windows platforms, memory pointers are 64 bits
   long, which is greater than the capacity of Javascript's
   number type.  It's therefore possible that this conversion
   won't be reversible.  It's better to use toUint64() if
   you need a faithful representation of the address. 
   However, regular Javascript numbers are somewhat easier
   to work with, so you can use this routine for cases where
   it's okay to lose precision, such as debugging or
   informational displays.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="toString"></a>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toString():</b>  Returns a string
   representation of the pointer.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For any of the Windows string
   types (LPSTR, LPWSTR, etc), the routine will attempt to
   interpret the data at the pointer as a null-terminated C-style
   string, and will return a Javascript string containing the
   text.  For a single-byte string type (LPSTR, LPCSTR), the
   bytes of the string will be taken to be in the local ANSI
   character set, and will be converted to the corresponding
   Unicode characters for the result string (since Javascript
   uses Unicode internally for strings).

   <li>For any other type, a generic representation is used,
   showing the pointer's memory address as a hexadecimal number.
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="toStringZ"></a>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toStringZ(<i>options</i>):</b>  Attempts
   to interpret the native data at the pointer as a zero-terminated
   string.  The pointer must refer to an 8-bit or 16-bit integer
   type:  char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short, INT8, INT16,
   etc.  An error is thrown if this is called for any other
   pointer type.
</p>
<p>
   The "Z" in toStringZ() is for "Zero-terminated".  The
   convention used in the C language, and many Windows API
   functions, is to represent a string as an array of
   characters, with a "null" character marking the end
   of the string.  A null character is a character with
   ASCII or Unicode value zero.  (That's <i>not</i>
   the character representing the digit '0' when printed.
   The digit '0' has ASCII/Unicode value 48.
   "Null" is a separate character with the code value 0.
   It doesn't have any standard printed representation;
   it's normally reserved for special purposes
   like this.)
</p>
<p>
   <i>options</i>, if present, is an object with any of the
   properties listed below.  This lets you control some
   details of how the character conversion is done.  Any of the
   properties can be omitted to use the corresponding defaults,
   and the entire <i>options</i> argument can be omitted to
   use all default settings.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b><i>options.</i>codePage:</b> a number giving the
      Windows code page to use for converting a single-byte
      character string, or the string "utf8" to interpret
      the bytes as UTF-8 characters.  The system's current
      ANSI code page, which is determined by the Windows
      localization control panel settings, is used by
      default.  This is ignored if the pointer points to
      a 16-bit integer type, since 16-bit characters are
      always taken to be Unicode characters, which require
      no character set conversion.
      <p>
         Standard Windows code pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>437 - IBM PC US (DOS box code page)
         <li>1250 = Latin 2 - Central European
         <li>1251 = Cyrillic
         <li>1252 = Latin 1 - Western European
         <li>1253 = Greek
         <li>1254 = Turkish
         <li>1255 = Hebrew
         <li>1256 = Arabic
         <li>1257 = Baltic
         <li>1258 = Vietnamese
         <li>"utf8" = Unicode UTF-8
      </ul>

   <li><b><i>options.</i>maxLength:</b> a number giving
      the maximum number of array elements to read from the
      memory at the pointer.  The conversion proceeds until
      a zero terminator character is reached or this maximum
      length is reached, whichever comes first.
      If this is omitted, the string continues until a zero
      terminator is reached, with no a priori length limit.
      <p>
         Note that the length is specified in terms of array
         elements in the source memory buffer, not characters
         in the result string.  
         Some single-byte encodings, including UTF8, can
         use a varying number of bytes per character, so
         the resulting string might be shorter (in
         character count) than your maxLength value.
      </p>

   <li><b><i>options.</i>length:</b> a number giving
      the exact length in array elements to read from the
      memory at the pointer.  If a zero character code is
      encountered before the length is reached, it's
      included as a character in the Javascript string.
      Javascript itself doesn't use zero terminators to
      mark the ends of strings, so a zero character code
      is perfectly valid within a Javascript string.
      if this is omitted, the string continues up to
      but not including the first zero terminator
      character reached.
      <p>
         If both length and maxLength are supplied, and
         maxLength is smaller, maxLength takes precedence.
         (It is, after all, the <i>maximum</i> length.)
      </p>
</ul>

<p>
   <b><i>pointer</i>.toUint64():</b>  Returns a
   <a href="Int64.html">Uint64</a> value representing the
   memory address contained in the pointer.  This should be
   used instead of toNumber() if you need a faithful
   representation of the full address, since pointers on
   64-bit Windows systems might not fit into the native
   Javascript number type.
</p>
