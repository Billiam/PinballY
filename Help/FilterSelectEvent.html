<h1>FilterSelectEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when a new filter is selected for
   the wheel UI.
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
<ul>
   <li><b>filterselect:</b> Fires when a new filter is selected.  This
   event fires before the filter is put into effect, so you can cancel
   the event to prevent the filter change.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object.
</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  In addition, it
   has the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b>  A string containing the ID of the new filter.  You can
   pass this to <a href="GameList.html#getFilterInfo">gameList.getFilterInfo</a>
   to retrieve more information on the filter.

</ul>

</body>
