<h1>Joystick Game Switcher</h1>

<p>
   Starting with version 1.1, PinballY provides Javascript with fairly
   extensive access to the joysticks.  We can use this to implement a
   feature that a few people have asked for, which is to use
   joysticks as command inputs.
</p>
<p>
   I'm not talking about using joystick
   <i>buttons</i> for command inputs, which is something that PinballY
   has always supported natively.  You can map joystick buttons to
   commands right in the settings dialog, under the Buttons section.
</p>
<p>
   The new feature I'm talking about here is using the <i>stick</i>
   part of the joystick as a command input.  For this example, we're
   going to use the stick as a game switcher: tilt it to the right
   to navigate to the next game on the game wheel, tilt it left to
   go to the previous game.
</p>

<h2>Getting access to the joystick device</h2>

<p>
   Javascript gains access to the joystick devices via
   <a href="JoystickInfo.html">JoystickInfo</a> objects, which you
   obtain from <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>.
   That method can be used in two ways: it can give you information on a
   particular joystick, such as the joystick that's the source of
   a <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">joystick button event</a>
   or <a href="JoystickAxisEvent.html">axis event</a> that you're
   currently handling; or, it can give you a list of all of the
   joysticks that PinballY knows about.  When you're writing a
   script that's that sets up its own special-purpose joystick
   handling, it's that second use - getting all the joysticks -
   that you'll want to use.
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let allJoysticks = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo();
</div>
<p>
   Okay, we have a list of joysticks; now what?  We need to pick
   the one that we're going to use for game-switcher input.  If
   you only have one joystick device in your system, this is
   probably going to be as easy as picking the first one that
   getJoystickInfo() returned.  The "list of all joysticks" is
   actually an array of JoystickInfo objects, so to pick the
   first, we just pull out element [0] from the array:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let joystick = allJoysticks[0];
</div>
<p>
   But that's not very robust.  If you ever add another joystick
   to your system, it might end up being listed in the array before
   your existing one, so that code could pick the wrong joystick.
   Another problem is that you might already have a couple of
   joystick-like devices in your system even if you don't think
   of them as actual joysticks.  All of the common pin cab plunger
   controllers pretend to be joysticks, for example, because
   joysticks just fit in easily; Windows and Visual Pinball and
   everything else already knows how to access them.
</p>
<p>
   Instead of just picking the first joystick in the list, then,
   we should somehow scan the list and pick out the one that we
   actually want.  There are several ways to do this, because
   the JoystickInfo object gives you all sorts of information
   on each joystick that you can use to identify the particular
   one that you want to use for the game switcher function.
   For the purposes of this example, let's keep it really simple
   and just look for a joystick with a particular product name
   string.  "Product name" is one of the basic attributes that
   joysticks report to Windows through the USB interface, and
   Windows passes it along to PinballY, which passes it along
   to Javascript through the JoystickInfo object.  So we can
   scan the list and find the one that matches the name we're
   looking for:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let joystick = allJoysticks.find(j => /pinscape/i.test(j.productName));
</div>
<p>
   That searches for the first joystick in the list that has
   "pinscape" somewhere in its product name.  The "/.../" notation
   is a Javascript regular expression, which in this case is just
   a literal string we're searching for.  The "i" after the second
   slash is for "<b>i</b>nsensitive to case", meaning that the
   search ignores upper/lower case differences and just matches
   either way.
</p>
<p>
   I'm just using the Pinscape device as an example - you can
   use the same idea with any other joystick or gamepad device.
   Just change <b>/pinscape/</b> to
   a similar substring that's unique to the device you're
   looking for.  There's an easy way to
   determine the product name string for your joystick, by the way:
   it'll be listed in the Windows joystick control panel.
   Fire up the Windows <b>Set up USB Game Controllers</b> control
   panel (press Windows+R and type <b>joy.cpl</b>).  The list of
   installed controllers that you see there is actually a list of
   the USB product name strings.  Find your device in that list,
   and pick out a suitable substring to use in the regular
   expression search.  I like looking for a substring rather than
   matching the whole name exactly, only because the name might
   change if you ever update the device's firmware.  The trick
   is to pick a substring that's likely to remain the same in
   all future updates, but that's also unique enough that it
   won't accidentally match some other device in your system.
</p>

<h2>Letting the user select the joystick</h2>
<p>
   A better way of selecting the joystick, albeit a more
   complicated way, is to let the user make the selection
   through the UI, and store it in the option settings file.
   That's outlined in a separate example,
   <a href="JoystickSelectionExample.html">Joystick Selection Menu</a>.
   You can combine the code from that example with the event
   handler here, if you want to use that technique for
   selecting the device.
</p>


<h2>Setting a value range</h2>
<p>
   The USB specs allow joysticks to report their control
   axis positions on scales of their own choosing.  The
   positions are always expressed as integer values, but the
   range - minimum to maximum - is up to the device to define.
   Windows passes the device's raw readings to PinballY, and
   PinballY passes them along to Javascript.  That
   maintains the integrity of the data; there's
   no chance of losing any precision due to rescaling
   arithmetic.  But it's a pain to deal with in
   Javascript, since we can't make any assumptions about
   the value range of the axes.  "X" could be a number
   from 0 to 100, or it could be -100,000,000 to +100,000,000.
   Or just about anything else.  If we want to know when
   the stick is halfway to the right, say, we don't know
   if we should look for an "X" value over 50 or over
   50 million.
</p>
<p>
   The JoystickInfo object provides you with the range of
   each axis, so you could use that to figure out the relative
   position.  But there's an easier way: we can tell
   the JoystickInfo object to scale the raw reading from the
   device to a range of our choosing.  The trade-off is that
   the rescaling can lose a little precision, so it's not the
   right choice for an application that needs the exact
   hardware readings.  But for most applications, it's just
   fine, and it makes things a lot easier.  For this example,
   let's put the X and Y axes on a fixed scale from -1000 to +1000:
</p>
<div class="code">
joystick.setAxisRange("X", -1000, 1000);
joystick.setAxisRange("Y", -1000, 1000);
</div>
<p>
   After that, when we read the axis values from the <b>X()</b>
   and <b>Y()</b> methods, they'll be reported on our new
   scale.  So the joystick is halfway right if X() &gt;= 500.
</p>


<h2>Enabling axis change events</h2>
<p>
   Now that we have our device, we have to enable it for axis change
   events.  PinballY doesn't generate these events by default,
   out of a desire to minimize any performance impact.  Joysticks
   can generate a lot of updates, and if there isn't any Javascript
   code interested in those update events, sending them to
   Javascript would just burn up CPU time for no good reason.
   So PinballY ignores joystick events by default, but it lets
   you enable them if you have a use for them.
</p>
<p>
   (Don't worry that
   this is going to bog down your system horribly.  The basic
   overhead isn't that much: it only takes about 50 microseconds
   to dispatch one of these events.  Most joysticks send updates
   about every 10 milliseconds, so enabling events for one
   joystick adds about one half of 1% of overhead.  Not so
   much that you'd notice.  But the effect is additive across
   joysticks, so it's still good that any other joysticks in
   your system that aren't of interest to Javascript won't
   generate any added overhead.)
</p>
<p>
   To enable joystick axis events, we go back to the JoystickInfo
   object that we selected for the joystick of interest, and we
   call the method <a href="JoystickInfo.html#enableAxisEvents">enableAxisEvents()</a>,
   telling it which axes we're interested in hearing about:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
joystick.enableAxisEvents({ axis: ["X", "Y"] });
</div>

<p>
   We listed "X" and "Y" as the axes of interest, so PinballY
   will only generate events when one of these axes changes.
   For standard joysticks, the "X" axis represents the
   left-to-right position of the main stick, and the "Y"
   axis represents the front-to-back position.  So if we
   listen for "X" and "Y" changes, we'll get notified
   every time the basic 2D position of the main stick
   changes.
</p>

<h2>Listening for axis changes</h2>

<p>
   Now that axis change events are enabled, we can set up an
   event listener to monitor the device.  We'll get called
   whenever the joystick moves enough to register a different
   axis reading.  For details on the axis change event,
   see <a href="JoystickAxisEvent.html">JoystickAxisEvent</a>.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("joystickaxischange", ev => {
    if (ev.unit == joystick.unit) {
        // it's our joystick of interest - do something here!
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   We start by checking that the joystick that generated the
   event is the same one that we're monitoring.  This might seem
   pointless, since we've only just enabled events for the one
   joystick, but this could become important if you add more modules
   later that might monitor other joysticks.  We match the joystick
   in this case by checking the <b>unit</b> property in the event
   against the <b>unit</b> property in our JoystickInfo object.
   Those properties contain the "logical unit numbers" of the respective
   joysticks.  The logical unit number is an internal ID that PinballY
   assigns to each joystick device for the duration of this program
   session, and it's designed for exactly this kind of situation.
   If the unit number in the event matches the unit number in
   our JoystickInfo object, we know that we're talking about the
   same actual joystick device.  (The unit number doesn't mean
   anything to Windows, or to any other programs - it's purely
   internal to PinballY.)
</p>
<p>
   How are we going to use these events to trigger game switching?
   Well, the first thing we have to do is pick a threshold for
   how far the stick has to move before we count it as a
   Next/Previous gesture.  That's entirely a matter of taste,
   so you'll undoubtedly want to fine-tune this to your liking,
   but for now let's just say 1/4 deflection to the left or
   to the right is enough to trigger a change.  Remember that
   we already adjusted the range that the axis values will report
   to -1000 to +1000, so 1/4 deflection to the left will be
   X() &lt;= -250, and 1/4 to the right will be X() &gt;= 250.
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
if (joystick.X() &lt;= -250) {
    // moving left
}
else if (joystick.X() &gt;= 250) {
    // moving right
}
</div>
<p>
   In practice, I've found that joysticks can be a little
   "noisy" around a threshold like this - they're analog
   devices, after all.  I think it's better to build in a
   little hysteresis: you have to move a little past the
   threshold before the joystick command kicks in, and
   you have to move a little further the other direction
   before it shuts off.  Here's how we can add 25 units
   of hysteresis, to make the transitions a little
   smoother:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let x = joystick.X(), r = Math.abs(x);
if (previouslyOff &amp;&amp; x &gt; 275) {
    // turn on
}
else if (previouslyOn &amp;&amp; x &lt; 225) {
    // turn off
}
</div>
<p>
   Now you have to move just a little past the threshold
   (25 extra units) in each direction before the command
   will take effect, and then it'll stay in effect until
   you move a little past the threshold in the opposite
   direction.
</p>

<h2>Switching the game</h2>

<p>
   To perform the game switch, we'll simply simulate a button
   press on the Next or Previous button, using
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doButtonCommand">mainWindow.doButtonCommand</a>:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.doButtonCommand("Next", true, 0); // navigate right
mainWindow.doButtonCommand("Prev", true, 0); // navigate left
</div>


<h2>Auto-repeat</h2>
<p>
   When you use mainWindow.doButtonCommand() to send
   one of the wheel navigation commands, the command will
   automatically repeat until you call doButtonCommand()
   again to turn the button "off", by calling it with
   <b>false</b> in the <i>down</i> argument slot (the second argument).
   This makes it really important that we continue to monitor the
   joystick after ending the initial command, so that we can
   PinballY to stop repeating the command once the joystick
   is no longer deflected enough to trigger it.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the strategy we're going to use in the command handler
   to accomplish this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>We'll keep track of the "old" command we've been repeating.
   We'll keep this in a variable <i>outside of</i> the event handler,
   so that Javascript remembers it from one event handler call
   to the next.  Initially, this is empty (in Javascript terms,
   <b>undefined</b>).

   <li>On each event handler call, we'll check the joystick position,
   using the hysteresis threshold we mentioned earlier, to see if
   it's currently deflected enough in one direction or the other
   to trigger a Next or Previous command.  If it is, we'll call
   this the "new" command for this event.  If not, we'll set the
   "new" command to <b>undefined</b>.

   <li>If the "new" command and the "old" command are the same,
   we'll just do nothing and let the command keep repeating (or not,
   if there isn't an old command).

   <li>If the "new" command are the "old" command are different,
   we'll turn off the old command and turn on the new one.  This
   ensures that we eventually stop repeating each command, once
   once the "new" command becomes <b>undefined</b>.
</ul>
<p>
   The nice thing about this approach is that it leaves the
   details of the repeat timing to PinballY.  The rate of the
   joystick events won't affect the wheel spin rate, since we
   only have to pay attention to when the wheel spin starts
   and stops.  As long as the joystick is deflected far enough
   to the left or right to trigger the command, we just let
   PinballY handle spinning the wheel; we only have to get
   involved again when the joystick returns to the center
   position, at which point we stop the wheel spin.
</p>

<h2>Fine-tuning the repeat rate</h2>
<p>
   PinballY's wheel spin auto-repeat rate is designed around the
   idea that it's going to be triggered by button presses.  Most
   people expect that to act the same way as a keyboard key does
   when you press it and hold it, so the default wheel repeat
   rate is the same as the Windows keyboard repeat rate.  You
   can customize that rate in the settings (see <a href="GameWheelOptions.html">Game Wheel Options</a>),
   but even so, the joystick can benefit from some special
   treatment.  A button is just an
   on-off switch, but a joystick is <i>analog</i> - it doesn't
   just go left and right, but goes left and right by
   continuously varying degrees.  To me, it would feel natural
   in this context to use the amount of deflection to
   control the speed: move it just a little to the left right for
   slow wheel spin, all the way to the left or right for
   really fast spin, and smoothly varying speeds in between.
</p>
<p>
   We can accomplish this via <a href="MainWindowObject.html#setWheelAutoRepeatRate">mainWindow.setWheelAutoRepeatRate()</a>,
   which lets us set the "instantaneous" repeat rate during a wheel spin
   command.  Since we're already monitoring the joystick position via
   our event handler, we can simply add a call to this method from
   our event handler, setting a new speed based on the latest
   joystick position.
</p>
<p>
   <b>setWheelAutoRepeatRate</b> sets the rate in milliseconds, so
   we just need to choose a range of repeat times for various degrees
   of joystick deflection:
</p>
<div class="code javascript">
let x = js.X(), r = Math.abs(x);
mainWindow.setWheelAutoRepeatRate(
    r &gt; 850 ? 100 : r &gt; 750 ? 200 : r &gt; 500 ? 300 : 500);
</div>
<p>
   You can adjust that to add as many gradations of speed as you
   like, and to speed up or slow down the extremes to fit what
   feels most comfortable to you.
</p>

<h2>The full event handler</h2>
<p>
   Putting all of those ideas together, here's what our full
   event handler looks like.
</p>

<div class="code javascript">
let oldCommand;
mainWindow.on("joystickaxischange", ev => {
    if (ev.unit == js.unit) {
        // check for crossing the threshold at 250, with hysteresis
        let x = js.X(), r = Math.abs(x);
        let newCommand = oldCommand;
        if (!oldCommand &amp;&amp; r &gt; 275)
            newCommand = (x &gt; 0 ? "Next" : "Prev");
        else if (oldCommand &amp;&amp; r &lt; 225)
            newCommand = undefined;

        // if the command changed, turn the button commands on/off
        if (newCommand !== oldCommand)
        {
            // turn off the old command button, if any
            if (oldCommand)
                mainWindow.doButtonCommand(oldCommand, false, 0);

            // turn on the new command button, if any
            if (newCommand)
                mainWindow.doButtonCommand(newCommand, true, 0);

            // remember the new command for next time
            oldCommand = newCommand;
        }

        // update the auto-repeat speed, according to how far the
        // joystick is deflected
        if (newCommand)
            mainWindow.setWheelAutoRepeatRate(
                r &gt; 850 ? 100 : r &gt; 750 ? 200 : r &gt; 500 ? 300 : 500);
    }
});

</div>
