<h1>Int64 and Uint64 Objects</h1>

<p>
   Int64 and Uint64 are object classes for handling 64-bit integer values.
   These are included primarily to support interaction with native code through the
   <a href="DllImport.html">DLL importer</a>, but you can use them for general
   purposes in Javascript as well.  The reason special classes are provided
   for these types is that many Windows APIs use 64-bit integers, but Javascript
   doesn't have its own primitive type or built-in object class that's capable
   of representing this kind of value.
</p>
<p>
   There are two kinds of 64-bit integers: signed and unsigned.  <b>Int64</b> is
   the signed type, and <b>Uint64</b> is the unsigned type.  (The "U" is for
   "unsigned", as you undoubtedly already guessed.  The naming and
   capitalization were chosen to parallel the names of the built-in Javascript
   Typed Array types, which use names like Int8Array, Uint8Array, etc.)
   
</p>
<p>"Signed" means
   that the type has a positive/negative sign as part of its value, so it can
   store both positive and negative numbers.  "Unsigned" means that there's no
   such sign information, so only positive (or zero) values can be stored.
   Why would you want the unsigned kind?  For one thing, some values are just
   inherently non-negative, such as a length or weight.  The more practical
   reason, though, is that the unsigned version of an integer type has twice
   as high an upper limit to the numbers it can store compared to the signed
   version, and the extra capacity is useful in some cases.
</p>
<p>
   The signed type, Int64, can hold values from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
</p>
<p>
   The unsigned type, Uint64, can hold values from 0 to 18446744073709551615.
</p>

<h3>Why do we need these?</h3>

<p>
   Because some Windows APIs use 64-bit integer values, and because
   Javascript can't adequately represent these values with any of
   its native types.
</p>
<p>
   The closest thing Javascript has is its standard Number type.
   A Javascript Number is
   represented as a "double precision floating point" value.  That's
   a standard format, the same one used in C/C++ for the "double" type.
   A double is actually a 64-bit type itself, but the 64 bits are
   divided up into several subfields, in such a way that you can only
   store 53 bits worth of "integer" information.  So if you have a 64-bit
   integer value that's outside of the 53-bit range - that is,
   -9007199254740991 to +9007199254740991 -
   you can't <i>precisely</i> represent it as a Javascript number.
   A Javascript number can only approximate it, with some of the
   digits at the end lost.  In contrast, a 64-bit integer can exactly
   represent every integer value over the wider ranges mentioned above.
</p>
<p>
   There's a weird paradox about converting between Javascript numbers
   and 64-bit integers: you can lose information doing a conversion in
   either direction.  Neither type is a full superset of the other.
   Javascript numbers have an "exponent"
   component (one of those bit subfields) that lets them represent
   very large and very small numbers, so they can be used to store
   values that are outside of the magnitude range of a 64-bit integer.
   But as described above, a 64-bit integer can store values with
   exact precision over a wider range.  So each type can represent
   certain values that the other can't.
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   You can create a 64-bit integer value with these classes using <b>new Int64(<i>value</i>)</b>
   and <b>new Uint64(<i>value</i>)</b>.  The <i>value</i> can be a number or a string
   representing a number.  
</p>
<div class="code">
let b = new Int64(1000000);
let a = new Int64("0x12345678ABCDEF");
</div>

<p>
   If you use a string, it's treated as a decimal (base 10) number by default.  You
   can specify a different radix as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>0x... specifies a hexadecimal (base 16) number, such as 0xFFFF1234
   <li>0... specifies an octal number: 07777
   <li>0b... specifies a binary number: 0b101001
</ul>

<p>
   If you pass a Javascript number as the argument, and the number is outside of
   the range that can be represented by the 64-bit integer type, an error is
   thrown.
</p>

<p>
   Alternatively, you can pass in an object with <b>high</b> and <b>low</b> properties
   representing the high-order 32 bits and low-order 32 bits of the value, respectively.
   This is the same format that the <b>toObject()</b> method returns, so you can use it
   to convert that format back into a proper 64-bit integer value.
</p>
<div class="code">
let c = new Int64({high: 0x1234, low: 0x5678ABCD}); // same as new Int64("0x12345678ABCD")
</div>

<h2>Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
   Int64 and Uint64 values are objects, so Javascript won't let us
   perform arithmetic on them using the normal algebraic symbols (+, -, *, /).
   To make up for this, the objects provide methods for performing the basic math
   operations.  Some examples:
</p>
<div class="code">
let a = new Int64('1000000000000');
let b = new Int64('2000000000000');
let c = a.add(b);          // c = a + b; a and b are unchanged
let d = a.mul(1000);       // you can use ordinary Javascript numbers as arguments, too
let e = a.sub('999');      // other types, like strings, are converted to Int64 implicitly
</div>

<p>
   The comparison operators (&gt, &lt;, ==, etc) don't work arithmetically on
   these values, either, for the same reason:  the comparison operators 
   treat these values as Javascript objects, not numbers.  For
   arithmetic comparisons, use the <b>compare()</b> method:
</p>
</p>
<div class="code">
if (a.compare(b) &gt; 0) ...     // true if a &gt; b arithmetically
if (a.compare(b) &lt; 0) ...     // true if a &lt; b
if (a.compare(b) == 0) ...    // true if a == b
</div>

<p>
   All of the math operations return <i>new</i> Int64 or Uint64 objects
   representing the results.  The original value is never affected.  Like
   a Javascript string, the value contained in an Int64/Uint64 is immutable.
</p>
<p>
   The math methods accept Int64, Uint64, number, or string values as arguments.
   Strings are parsed as numbers of the same type as the "this" object of the
   method.
</p>
<div class="code">
b = a.add(100).mul("2");  // add 100, then multiply by 2
</div>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   <b>add(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Adds <i>value</i> to the object's value and returns
   a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the result.  <i>value</i> can be
   specified as a Javascript number or a string; in either case, the value is
   converted to an Int64/Uint64 according to the same rules used in "new"
   (including an error if the value is too large for the 64-bit integer type).
   No error is thrown if the result of the addition overflows;
   the result simply truncates overflow bits, the same as normal native integer
   arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
   <b>and(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Performs a bit-wise AND operation on this object's value and <i>value</i>,
   and returns a new Int64 or Uint64 representing the result.
</p>

<p>
   <b>ashr(<i>bits</i>)</b>:  Performs the Javascript &gt;&gt; or "arithmetic
   right shift" operation.  Bit-shifts the object's  value right by <i>bits</i> bits,
   retaining its sign, and returns a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the
   result.  The "arithmetic" right-shift operation differs from the "logical"
   right-shift in that the arithmetic version retains the sign (positive or negative)
   of the original value.
   This has the effect of dividing the value by 2<sup><i>bits</i></sup>,
   discarding any fractional part of the result (rounding towards zero).
</p>

<p>
   <b>compare(<i>value</i>)</b>: Compares the object's value to <i>value</i>,
   returning -1 if the "this" object is less than <i>value</i>, 0 if the values
   are equal, 1 if "this" is greater than <i>value</i>.  The return value is
   a regular Javascript number, not another Int64 value.  When comparing
   signed to unsigned, the comparison is done so that it yields the
   mathematically correct result.
</p>

<p>
   <b>div(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Divides the object's value by <i>value</i> returns
   a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the result.  The division is done
   as an integer quantity, so any fractional part is discarded without rounding.
</p>

<p>
   <b>lshr(<i>bits</i>)</b>:  Performs the Javascript &gt;&gt;&gt; or "logical
   right shift" operation.  Bit-shifts the object's  value right by <i>bits</i> bits,
   discarding its sign, and returns a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the
   result.  The "logical" right-shift operation differs from the "arithmetic"
   right-shift in that the logical version discards the sign of the original
   value; the high bits are filled with zeros after the shift.
   This is roughly the same as dividing the value by 2<sup><i>bits</i></sup>, except
   that its effect on negative values is different from a regular division because
   of the way the sign bit is always zeroed.
</p>

<p>
   <b>mod(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Divides the object's value by <i>value</i>  and returns
   a new Int64 or Uint64 representing the "modulo" value, or integer remainder.
   This uses the hardware platform rules for negative values.
</p>

<p>
   <b>mul(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Multiplies the object's value by <i>value</i>, and returns
   a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the result.  No error is thrown on overflow;
   the result simply truncates overflow bits, the same as normal native integer
   arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
   <b>negate()</b>:  Returns a new Int64/Uint64 object containing the negative of the
   object's value.
</p>

<p>
   <b>not()</b>:  Returns a new Int64/Uint64 object containing the binary complement
   of object's value's bits.
</p>

<p>
   <b>or(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Performs a bit-wise OR operation on this object's value and <i>value</i>,
   and returns a new Int64 or Uint64 representing the result.
</p>

<p>
   <b>shl(<i>bits</i>)</b>:  Performs the Javascript &lt;&lt; or "left shift" operation.
   This bit-shifts the object's value left by <i>bits</i> bits, returning a new Int64 or Uint64
   object representing the result.  This has the effect of multiplying the value by 2<sup><i>bits</i></sup>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>sub(<i>value</i>)</b>:  Subtracts <i>value</i> from the object's value and returns
   a new Int64 or Uint64 object representing the result.  No error is thrown on overflow;
   the result simply truncates overflow bits, the same as normal native integer
   arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
   <b>toNumber()</b>: Returns the value represented as an ordinary Javascript
   number.  Javascript numbers can only store integer values accurately from
   -9007199254740991 to 9007199254740991, which is smaller than the 64-bit integer
   range (technically, the Javascript numeric representation provides the
   equivalent of a 53-bit integer range).  If the value in the Int64 or Uint64
   is outside of this range, toNumber() throws an error.
</p>

<p>
   <b>toObject(<i></i>)</b>: Returns an object with two properties, <b>high</b>
   and <b>low</b>, containing Javascript number values giving the high-order 32
   bits and low-order 32-bits of the 64-bit value.  For example:
</p>
<div class="code">
let l = new Int64("0x12345678abcdef99");
let o = l.toObject();
message("o.high=" + o.high.toString(16) + ", o.low=" + o.low.toString(16));
// displays: o.high=12345678, o.low=abcdef99
</div>
<p>
   For a signed (Int64) value, the <b>high</b> part has the same sign
   as the 64-bit value.  The low part is unsigned regardless of the sign of
   64-bit value, so it's always positive.
</p>
<div class="code">
o = l.toObject(new Int64(-1));
message("o.high=" + o.high + ", o.low=" + o.low);
// displays: o.high=-1, o.low=4294967295
</div>


<p>
   The point of the object format is that it lets you do arithmetic in the
   Javascript domain, by decomposing the large number into two smaller values
   that fit in the regular Javascript numeric type.  You can use this for any operations
   that you can't express conveniently in terms of the math methods that Int64
   provides.  You can convert the result back to a
   proper 64-bit integer object by passing it as the argument to new Int64()
   or new Uint64().
</p>

<p>
   <b>toString(<i>radix</i>)</b>:  Converts the value to a string representation.
   The optional <i>radix</i> is a number from 2 to 36 specifying the radix (base)
   for the string version; the default is decimal (base 10).
</p>
