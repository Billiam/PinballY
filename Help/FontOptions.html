<h1>Font and Color Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you customize the text fonts and colors used
   throughout the PinballY user interface.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Default Font</b> is the master control.  This lets you
   select the font family that will be used for all of the other
   task-specific fonts by default.  This will be used for all of the
   other items below for which you don't select different fonts.
   The initial setting for all of the other fonts is "*",
   meaning "use the master default font", so you can change
   all of the program's text displays through this one option.
</p>
<p>
   The rest of the entries let you select the fonts used in
   specific places in the program.  These individual options let
   you select different fonts for different functions; for example,
   you can set a specific font just for menu text, and a different
   font just for popup boxes.
</p>
<p>
   For each of of the function-specific font options, you can
   specify the font name, point size, and style (normal, bold,
   or bold italic).
   For each field, "*" means "use the default", which is to say:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For font names, the default is the master Default Font chosen
   at the top of the dialog

   <li>For point sizes, the default is a system-defined size that
   varies by function

   <li>For styles, the default is also a system-defined style for
   the function, but this is currently just "normal" for everything
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Menus:</b>  The font used for the line items in pop-up menus.
</p>
<p>
   Each entry also lets you select a color for the text shown in
   that context.  Some of the items also have a second button in
   the "Bkg" column, for the background color.  For items that
   are displayed in popup boxes, this is the color used for the
   popup box background.  For the wheel titles and status messages,
   the "background" instead refers to the color of the drop shadow
   effect displayed with the text, since these items are overlaid
   directly on the main background without a popup box.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Menu Headers:</b>  Some menus have a short paragraph of explanatory
   text at the top.  This is the font used for that top section.  The
   default size is a bit smaller than the normal menu font, since this
   text tends to be quite a bit lengthier than the menu's line item, so
   a smaller font looks a little nicer (and fits better).
</p>

<p>
   <b>Popups:</b>  The main text in a popup box.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Popup Titles:</b>  The large title text shown at the top of a popup box.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Popup smaller text:</b>  A smaller font for popup box text, for items
   that we want to be a little less conspicuous but still be visible.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Popup detail text:</b>  An even smaller font for technical detail text,
   which we want to be even less conspicuous.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Media detail text:</b>  A small font for details shown in the media
   file list popup display.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Wheel titles:</b>  A large font used to display title text in
   the "wheel" for games that don't have graphical wheel image files.
</p>
<p>
   <b>High scores list:</b>  Text showing the high scores in the
   high scores popup box.  (This is the popup box that you can bring up
   via the "High Scores" command in the main menu, not the automatic
   high score display show in the DMD window.  The DMD version uses
   a different style meant to simulate the original score panel style
   for each game.)
</p>
<p>
   <b>Info box titles:</b>  Title text in game info boxes.  (These are
   the boxes that automatically appear on screen when there isn't
   something else showing, such as a menu or popup dialog.)
</p>
<p>
   <b>Info box text:</b>  Main text in game info boxes.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Info box detail text:</b>  A smaller font for details in game info boxes.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Status line text:</b>  The informational message text that appears at the
   bottom of the main window.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Coin/credit messages:</b>  Messages that appear briefly when you press
   the "coin" button (or insert a coin, if your cabinet has a coin slot
   that's set up to send button presses to the program).
</p>
<p>
   <b>Launch status:</b>  Messages that appear during the game launch process.
   The background color is used by default as the background for the main
   playfield window during the launch.  This is, of course, ignored if you
   provide a custom background image or video (see
   <a href="LaunchBackgrounds.html">Launch Backgrounds</a>).
