<h1>Startup Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you customize how PinballY gets launched, and gives
   you some options for what happens each time the program starts running.
</p>

<h2>How to start PinballY</h2>

<p>
   <b>Manually:</b>  Select this option if you want to start the program
   manually from the Windows desktop each time.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatically:</b>  Select this to make the program start automatically
   each time you log in to Windows.  Pin cab users will usually want to select
   this option, since it launches PinballY as soon as you boot up your system,
   so that you never have to interact with the normal Windows desktop during a
   gaming session.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatic Administrator mode:</b>  Like the previous option, this
   setting launches PinballY automatically when you log in, but in this case
   the program is launched with Administrator privileges.  This allows
   PinballY to launch games in Admin mode without any Windows UAC (User
   Access Control) warnings.  That makes for a smoother playing experience
   if you have any games that in fact require Admin privileges.
</p>
<p>
   Even if you're accustomed to having to use Administrator mode with
   PinballX or other systems, I'd recommend trying to run PinballY in
   normal user mode first, to make sure you really need Admin mode.
   PinballY has special awareness of the privilege modes required by
   the game programs it launches, so it should be able to tell you
   if you run anything actually requiring Admin mode.  It's better to
   run in normal user mode unless PinballY explicitly tells you that
   Admin mode is required for a particular program.
</p>

<h2>Wait for monitors</h2>

<p>
   This group of options lets you tell PinballY to wait for all of your
   monitors to come online before launching.
</p>
<p>
   This is useful in pin cabs that have multiple monitors (which is
   most pin cabs!), since it lets you ensure that Windows has a chance
   to restore your full normal desktop area before PinballY attempts to
   position any of its windows.  In a multi-monitor setup, Windows will
   sometimes boot up faster than the TVs, so there can be a brief period
   during system startup where Windows is running but hasn't fully restored
   your normal desktop area.  This sorts itself out in due course,
   since Windows adds each TV to the desktop as it comes online,
   but it can be problematic for a program like PinballY that
   you launch automatically at system startup.  The snag is that Windows
   might launch PinballY during this interval when the desktop area is
   still incomplete.  If your window layout uses any of that missing
   area, PinballY might not be able to restore the full layout properly.
</p>
<p>
   So what you really want to do is have a way to tell Windows: "launch
   this program at system startup, but not until all of the monitors
   are ready."  That's exactly what the "wait for monitors" setting does.
   It makes PinballY deliberately stop and wait until all of your
   monitors are online.
</p>
<p>
   To use this feature, check the "Wait for monitors" box, then adjust
   the "number of monitors" and "wait time" boxes to match your system.
   The wait time is only the maximum time limit; PinballY will stop waiting
   as soon as all of the monitors are online if that happens before the
   wait time limit has been reached.  The wait time is only there to make
   sure that things don't stall for too long if you happen to boot up
   without all of your monitors connected.  You can also always cancel
   the wait manually if necessary, since PinballY shows a little dialog
   box with a "Cancel" button throughout the wait.
</p>

<h2>Splash screen</h2>

<p>
   The program normally displays a "splash screen" for a few seconds
   each time you launch it, showing the program name and version number.
   Un-check this box to skip the splash screen.
</p>

<h2>Run command at startup/exit</h2>

<p>
   These boxes let you enter commands that PinballY will run when it
   starts up, and just before it exits, respectively.
</p>
<p>
   Use the normal Windows command line syntax here, as though you
   were typing a command into the Windows+R "Run" box.
   A few tips:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Specify the full drive name and folder path to the program
      you want to run: <tt>C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe</tt>

   <li>If the path or program name contain any spaces, be sure to
      enclose the whole program name in double quotes:
      <tt>"C:\Visual Pinball\vpinball.exe"</tt>

   <li>To use DOS-box commands or .BAT or .CMD batch/script files,
      use CMD.EXE:  <tt>cmd.exe /c MyBatchScript.bat</tt>

   <li>If you need to run a series of commands, create a batch
      file (.BAT) that runs the commands, and use the CMD.EXE
      syntax above to invoke the batch script

</ul>
