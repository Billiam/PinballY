<h1>Startup Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you customize how PinballY gets launched, and gives
   you some options for what happens each time the program starts running.
</p>

<h2>How to start PinballY</h2>

<p>
   <b>Manually:</b>  Select this option if you want to start the program
   manually from the Windows desktop each time.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatically:</b>  Select this to make the program start automatically
   each time you log in to Windows.  Pin cab users will usually want to select
   this option, since it launches PinballY as soon as you boot up your system,
   so that you never have to interact with the normal Windows desktop during a
   gaming session.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatic Administrator mode:</b>  Like the previous option, this
   setting launches PinballY automatically when you log in, but in this case
   the program is launched with Administrator privileges.  This allows
   PinballY to launch games in Admin mode without any Windows UAC (User
   Access Control) warnings.  That makes for a smoother playing experience
   if you have any games that in fact require Admin privileges.
</p>
<p>
   Even if you're accustomed to having to use Administrator mode with
   PinballX or other systems, you might not have to do this with
   PinballY.  I'd strongly recommend trying normal user mode first.
   PinballY has special awareness of the privilege modes required by
   the game programs it launches, so it should be able to tell you
   if you run anything actually requiring Admin mode.  It's better to
   run in normal user mode unless PinballY explicitly tells you that
   Admin mode is required for a particular program.  The big reason
   to avoid Admin mode is that it creates a lot of complications for
   all of your other programs, because Windows restricts a lot of
   the normal program-to-program interactions when an Admin program
   is running.
</p>

<p>
   <b>After logon, pause before starting PinballY:</b>  If you wish, you
   can delay the automatic launch at logon by a specified
   time in seconds.  This value is only used if you select one of the
   Automatic modes.  A startup delay can be useful to clear up conflicts
   with other programs that you're also launching at Windows startup.
   Some example of when this could be helpful:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If another launch-at-startup program thrashes the disk
   or uses a lot of CPU time while it's loading, PinballY's
   initial video playback might look jumpy or glitchy.  Delaying
   PinballY's launch until the other program has settled down
   might help.

   <li>Another program launched at about the same time might
   steal keyboard focus away from PinballY, forcing you to click
   the mouse in a PinballY window to give it keyboard focus again.
   If you delay PinballY's startup so that it's the last program
   to launch at startup, it should reliably get the initial
   keyboard focus.
</ul>

<h2>Force keyboard focus to PinballY at startup</h2>

<p>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will try to force focus into its
   main window after the program starts up by simulating a mouse click,
   as though you were manually clicking the mouse in its main window.
   This should ensure that PinballY has keyboard focus, so that it
   responds properly to key presses.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases, PinballY doesn't get keyboard focus when you launch
   it automatically at Windows startup time.  This seems to be particularly
   problematic on Windows 10 because of intentional changes Microsoft made
   to Task Scheduler to prevent auto-launched programs from receiving
   keyboard focus.  It can be a problem on other systems as well, since
   other programs (or Windows itself) can "steal" focus away from PinballY.
   Focus is a global resource that different programs are always fighting
   over, so it's inherently a bit tricky to get everyone to agree where
   it should end up when a bunch of things are happening at once, such
   as during the Windows boot process.  This option is designed to
   work around any conflicts with other programs by forcing focus to
   the PinballY window in the most heavy-handed fashion possible, by
   simulating a mouse click to make it look like you manually clicked
   on the PinballY window to make it the active window.
</p>
<p>
   You can enter a delay time in the next line under the checkbox if
   desired.  In some cases, the focus change might not "stick" if it
   happens too early, since another program that starts up around the
   same time might try to do the same kind of thing to steal focus
   away.  The delay time lets you adjust the timing of the simulated
   mouse click so that it always happens after any other programs
   have also finished starting up.
</p>


<h2>Wait for monitors</h2>

<p>
   This group of options lets you tell PinballY to wait for all of your
   monitors to come online before launching.
</p>
<p>
   This is useful in pin cabs that have multiple monitors (which is
   most pin cabs!), since it lets you ensure that Windows has a chance
   to restore your full normal desktop area before PinballY attempts to
   position any of its windows.  In a multi-monitor setup, Windows will
   sometimes boot up faster than the TVs, so there can be a brief period
   during system startup where Windows is running but hasn't fully restored
   your normal desktop area.  This sorts itself out in due course,
   since Windows adds each TV to the desktop as it comes online,
   but it can be problematic for a program like PinballY that
   you launch automatically at system startup.  The snag is that Windows
   might launch PinballY during this interval when the desktop area is
   still incomplete.  If your window layout uses any of that missing
   area, PinballY might not be able to restore the full layout properly.
</p>
<p>
   So what you really want to do is tell Windows: "launch
   this program at system startup, but not until all of the monitors
   are ready."  That's exactly what the "wait for monitors" setting does.
   It makes PinballY deliberately stop and wait until all of your
   monitors are online.
</p>
<p>
   To use this feature, check the "Wait for monitors" box, then adjust
   the parameters:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Number of monitors:</b>  The minimum number of monitors that
   must be online before PinballY starts up.  PinballY will wait until
   Windows thinks that at least this many physical displays are active
   in the system.

   <li><b>Maximum wait time:</b>  The time limit on how long to wait.
   This is just a fail-safe, to make sure that PinballY doesn't get stuck
   forever if for some reason you're not going to attach all of your monitors
   for this session.  (You can also cancel the wait manually at any
   time, by clicking the Cancel button in the little dialog box that
   the program displays during the wait.)

   <li><b>Additional wait time:</b>  This is an extra delay time,
   in seconds, after all of the monitors have been recognized.  Some
   video cards have a quirk where they appear in Windows as soon as
   an attached TV is first turned on, but then drop out again for a
   couple of seconds while the TV establishes its connection.  The
   additional wait time can help work around such startup glitches.
</ul>


<h2>Initial window positioning</h2>

<p>
   The checkbox <b>Make sure all windows are positioned within the
   visible desktop area</b> lets you control the way PinballY
   sets up the initial window locations during program startup.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY always saves and restores the positions of all of
   your open windows between session.  That lets it restore the
   same window layout each time you start a new session.  This
   box tells PinballY what to do when a saved window position
   is outside of the bounds of the current display area.
</p>
<p>
   If this box is checked (which is the default), PinballY
   checks the position for each saved window to make sure that
   it's within the visible area of your desktop, meaning it's
   within the bounds of one of your display monitors.  If so,
   great, PinballY just restores the saved window position,
   so you get the same layout as during the last session.
   If the window <i>isn't</i> within the bounds of any active
   monitor, though, PinballY repositions the window to place
   it within the monitor that's closest to the saved location.
</p>
<p>
   If this box is un-checked, PinballY skips the extra scrutiny
   and simply restores the window at the exact saved position.
   If the window is outside the visible display area, so be it.
</p>
<p>
   Why you might want to leave this option enabled:  This option
   is enabled by default because it compensates for any changes
   you've made to your desktop layout since the last PinballY
   session.  Changes to the desktop layout can result in a
   saved window position placing the window outside of the
   visible screen area.  It's difficult to work with a window
   that's outside of the desktop bounds, because you can't move
   the mouse there to grab the window's title bar and
   reposition it.
</p>
<p>
   Why you might want to <i>disable</i> this option:  The
   automatic window fixup at startup can be problematic if you
   have to make special changes to your desktop layout when running
   other programs.  For example, some games don't work correctly unless
   you rotate a monitor, change the display resolution, or change the
   ordering of the monitors on the desktop before running it.  As a
   result, some people use tools that change the desktop layout each
   time they run a certain program.  In that situation, if the
   layout change happens at the wrong time, it can make PinballY think
   it needs to rearrange its windows even though that's not actually
   necessary, leaving your PinballY windows in the wrong locations.
   This can also happen if you use a remote-access program, since
   those programs often create a virtual monitor area while
   running, which has the side effect of changing the screen
   layout. 
</p>
<p>
   Note that disabling this option only works with windows that
   aren't in Full Screen mode.  Full-screen windows are always
   set up so that they fill the nearest monitor to the saved
   position, so they'll end up within a visible monitor in any
   case.  If you have problems with full-screen windows moving
   to unwanted monitors at startup, try taking them out of
   full-screen mode and instead using "borderless" mode (which
   you can select via the right-click menu within the window),
   simply sizing the window to the screen area you want it to
   take.
</p>
<p>
   How to find a window that's fallen off the edge of the world:
   As long as the main playfield window is still visible, you can
   easily bring any of the other windows back into view by
   right-clicking on the playfield window and selecting "Show
   <i>whichever window</i>" from the context menu.  If that window
   is off in some unreachable location, PinballY will move it back
   into the visible area.  If the playfield window itself is missing,
   and any other window is visible, right-click in one of the other
   windows and select "Show Main Window" from the menu.  If none
   of the windows are visible, your best bet is probably to delete
   the saved window position from the settings file manually:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Quit out of PinballY
   <li>Open the options file (Settings.txt) in Notepad
   <li>Find the line that starts with <b>PlayfieldWindow.Position =</b>
   <li>Delete that whole line
</ul>
<p>
   That will remove the problematic saved window position.  PinballY
   will open the window at a default position the next time you run,
   which should be somewhere within the main monitor.  You can then
   reposition it where you want it.
</p>

<h2>Splash screen</h2>

<p>
   The program normally displays a "splash screen" for a few seconds
   each time you launch it, showing the program name and version number.
   Un-check this box to skip the splash screen.
</p>

<h2>Run command at startup/exit</h2>

<p>
   These boxes let you enter commands that PinballY will run when it
   starts up, and just before it exits, respectively.
</p>
<p>
   Use the normal Windows command line syntax here, as though you
   were typing a command into the Windows+R "Run" box.
   A few tips:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Specify the full drive name and folder path to the program
      you want to run: <tt>C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe</tt>

   <li>If the path or program name contain any spaces, be sure to
      enclose the whole program name in double quotes:
      <tt>"C:\Visual Pinball\vpinball.exe"</tt>

   <li>To use DOS-box commands or .BAT or .CMD batch/script files,
      use CMD.EXE:  <tt>cmd.exe /c MyBatchScript.bat</tt>

   <li>If you need to run a series of commands, create a batch
      file (.BAT) that runs the commands, and use the CMD.EXE
      syntax above to invoke the batch script

</ul>
