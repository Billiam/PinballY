<h1>Startup Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you customize how PinballY gets launched, and gives
   you some options for what happens each time the program starts running.
</p>

<h2>How to start PinballY</h2>

<p>
   <b>Manually:</b>  Select this option if you want to start the program
   manually from the Windows desktop each time.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatically:</b>  Select this to make the program start automatically
   each time you log in to Windows.  Pin cab users will usually want to select
   this option, since it launches PinballY as soon as you boot up your system,
   so that you never have to interact with the normal Windows desktop during a
   gaming session.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Automatic Administrator mode:</b>  Like the previous option, this
   setting launches PinballY automatically when you log in, but in this case
   the program is launched with Administrator privileges.  This allows
   PinballY to launch games in Admin mode without any Windows UAC (User
   Access Control) warnings.  That makes for a smoother playing experience
   if you have any games that in fact require Admin privileges.
</p>
<p>
   Even if you're accustomed to having to use Administrator mode with
   PinballX or other systems, you might not have to do this with
   PinballY.  I'd strongly recommend trying normal user mode first.
   PinballY has special awareness of the privilege modes required by
   the game programs it launches, so it should be able to tell you
   if you run anything actually requiring Admin mode.  It's better to
   run in normal user mode unless PinballY explicitly tells you that
   Admin mode is required for a particular program.  The big reason
   to avoid Admin mode is that it creates a lot of complications for
   all of your other programs, because Windows restricts a lot of
   the normal program-to-program interactions when an Admin program
   is running.
</p>

<p>
   <b>After logon, pause before starting PinballY:</b>  If you wish, you
   can delay the automatic launch at logon by a specified
   time in seconds.  This value is only used if you select one of the
   Automatic modes.  A startup delay can be useful to clear up conflicts
   with other programs that you're also launching at Windows startup.
   Some example of when this could be helpful:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If another launch-at-startup program thrashes the disk
   or uses a lot of CPU time while it's loading, PinballY's
   initial video playback might look jumpy or glitchy.  Delaying
   PinballY's launch until the other program has settled down
   might help.

   <li>Another program launched at about the same time might
   steal keyboard focus away from PinballY, forcing you to click
   the mouse in a PinballY window to give it keyboard focus again.
   If you delay PinballY's startup so that it's the last program
   to launch at startup, it should reliably get the initial
   keyboard focus.
</ul>


<h2>Wait for monitors</h2>

<p>
   This group of options lets you tell PinballY to wait for all of your
   monitors to come online before launching.
</p>
<p>
   This is useful in pin cabs that have multiple monitors (which is
   most pin cabs!), since it lets you ensure that Windows has a chance
   to restore your full normal desktop area before PinballY attempts to
   position any of its windows.  In a multi-monitor setup, Windows will
   sometimes boot up faster than the TVs, so there can be a brief period
   during system startup where Windows is running but hasn't fully restored
   your normal desktop area.  This sorts itself out in due course,
   since Windows adds each TV to the desktop as it comes online,
   but it can be problematic for a program like PinballY that
   you launch automatically at system startup.  The snag is that Windows
   might launch PinballY during this interval when the desktop area is
   still incomplete.  If your window layout uses any of that missing
   area, PinballY might not be able to restore the full layout properly.
</p>
<p>
   So what you really want to do is tell Windows: "launch
   this program at system startup, but not until all of the monitors
   are ready."  That's exactly what the "wait for monitors" setting does.
   It makes PinballY deliberately stop and wait until all of your
   monitors are online.
</p>
<p>
   To use this feature, check the "Wait for monitors" box, then adjust
   the parameters:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Number of monitors:</b>  The minimum number of monitors that
   must be online before PinballY starts up.  PinballY will wait until
   Windows thinks that at least this many physical displays are active
   in the system.

   <li><b>Maximum wait time:</b>  The time limit on how long to wait.
   This is just a fail-safe, to make sure that PinballY doesn't get stuck
   forever if for some reason you're not going to attach all of your monitors
   for this session.  (You can also cancel the wait manually at any
   time, by clicking the Cancel button in the little dialog box that
   the program displays during the wait.)

   <li><b>Additional wait time:</b>  This is an extra delay time,
   in seconds, after all of the monitors have been recognized.  Some
   video cards have a quirk where they appear in Windows as soon as
   an attached TV is first turned on, but then drop out again for a
   couple of seconds while the TV establishes its connection.  The
   additional wait time can help work around such startup glitches.
</ul>


<h2>Splash screen</h2>

<p>
   The program normally displays a "splash screen" for a few seconds
   each time you launch it, showing the program name and version number.
   Un-check this box to skip the splash screen.
</p>

<h2>Run command at startup/exit</h2>

<p>
   These boxes let you enter commands that PinballY will run when it
   starts up, and just before it exits, respectively.
</p>
<p>
   Use the normal Windows command line syntax here, as though you
   were typing a command into the Windows+R "Run" box.
   A few tips:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Specify the full drive name and folder path to the program
      you want to run: <tt>C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe</tt>

   <li>If the path or program name contain any spaces, be sure to
      enclose the whole program name in double quotes:
      <tt>"C:\Visual Pinball\vpinball.exe"</tt>

   <li>To use DOS-box commands or .BAT or .CMD batch/script files,
      use CMD.EXE:  <tt>cmd.exe /c MyBatchScript.bat</tt>

   <li>If you need to run a series of commands, create a batch
      file (.BAT) that runs the commands, and use the CMD.EXE
      syntax above to invoke the batch script

</ul>
