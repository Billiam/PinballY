<h1>Customizing PinballY's Appearance</h1>

<p>
   PinballY lets you customize many aspects of its visual and audio presentation
   by providing your own images, video, and sound files, and through
   variables in the settings file and/or settings dialogs.  The sections below
   explain the various options.
</p>
<div id="TOC"></div>

<a name="mediaFolder"></a>
<h2>Media folder location</h2>
<p>
   All of the customizable media items go in subfolders of the
   main <b>Media</b> folder.  PinballY looks for the main Media folder
   in two locations, in this order:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, it looks in the <b>Media</b> folder within your PinballY
   program folder

   <li>Second, it uses the path set in the Media Folder option in the
   <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a> section in the settings
</ul>

<p>
   These two locations might be identical.  That's the case if you've
   chosen to keep all of your game media files within the PinballY install folder.
</p>
<p>
   But the two folder locations will be different if you're sharing game
   media files with a HyperPin or PinballX installation.  In that case,
   you can store your PinballY custom media files in either location.  The
   PinballY Media folder will be searched first, so files located there will
   take precedence.  This lets you share files by default with PinballX or
   HyperPin, while also letting you override selected files just for PinballY,
   without affecting the other program(s).  Just place the files you want to
   override in the PinballY\Media folder, and PinballY will use those files
   in preference to like-named files in the game media folder.
