<h1>System Objects</h1>

<p>
   PinballY provides a number of pre-defined Javascript
   objects for access to the application and user interface environment.
   These are analogous to the system objects in Web browser Javascript,
   such as "window" and "document", but are tailored to the PinballY
   environment instead of a browser environment.
</p>
<p>
   These objects are global, so you can access them by name anywhere
   in your scripting code.
