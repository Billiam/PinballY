<h1>Running an External Program</h1>

<p>
   For some types of customizations, you might want to launch an
   external program in response to some event in PinballY.  The
   most obvious case would be to launch a program when the user
   selects a custom menu command.   This is
   one of the simpler but more versatile approaches to customizing,
   since it lets you take some existing function that's already
   available via a separate program, and integrate it more or
   less seamlessly into the PinballY user interface.
</p>

<h2>Setting up the custom menu</h2>

<p>
   We'll start by setting up a custom menu command, which we'll
   add to the main menu.  We can do this by setting up a listener
   for the <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menuopen</b></a> event.
   When the listener recognizes that the main menu is being
   opened, it inserts our new custom command into the menu, and
   then lets the system show the modified menu as normal.  This
   technique is explained in full in
   <a href="MenuEvent.html#overrideSysMenu">Overriding a system menu</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Whenever we want to add a new custom command, we have to do one
   little bit of preparatory work, which is to allocate an ID for
   our command.  This just requires one line of code in the "global"
   part of the Javascript file (outside of any functions).
</p>
<div class="code">
let runCustomProgCommand = command.allocate("RunCustomProgram");
</div>
<p>
   Once we have the command ID, we can create the <b>menuopen</b>
   listener that modifies the main menu, placing our new command
   after the exiting "Rate Table" command.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "main") {
        ev.addMenuItem({after: command.RateGame},
            { title: "Run Custom Program", cmd: runCustomProgCommand });
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   You can use this same technique to add
   commands to any of the other standard menus, such as the Operator
   menu or Exit menu.  The only things you have to change to use
   a different menu are the menu ID string that you check
   (see <a href="Menus.html#systemMenus">System Menus</a> for
   a list of these) and the command ID you search for to determine the
   insertion location (see <a href="Commands.html#systemCommandIDs">System Command IDs</a>
   for those).
</p>

<h2>Launching the command</h2>

<p>
   Now that we have the menu item in place, we can write the code that
   responds to our new command by actually carrying out the custom program
   launch.  Processing a custom menu command requires writing a listener
   for the <a href="CommandEvent.html">command</a> event, and responding
   when the command ID in the event matches the custom command ID we
   created earlier.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == runCustomProgCommand) {
        // TO DO - carry out the command
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Javascript doesn't have any built-in way of launching an external
   program, so we'll use the <a href="DllImport.html">native DLL interface</a>
   to call a Windows system function that runs a command.  There are several
   Windows APIs for launching a program; the main ones are ShellExecute(),
   ShellExecuteEx(), and CreateProcess().  ShellExecute() is the easiest to
   use, so it's the one I'd recommend for simple cases where you just want
   to launch a command and don't need to interact with the new process
   after it's started.  ShellExecuteEx() and CreateProcess() give you more
   options, including the ability to monitor the process for completion, but
   they're more complex to use.  
</p>
<p>
   You can read all about the DLL import system in the chapter on
   <a href="DllImport.html">calling native DLLs</a>, so we won't repeat
   all of that here.  We'll just show the code needed for this specific
   situation.
</p>
<p>
   The first step is to "bind" the native Windows DLL function we need.
   Binding sets up a bridge from Javascript to the DLL so that we can
   call the function.
   We'll use the simple ShellExecute() API for this example.  Note that
   we have to call the function by its "full" name, ShellExecuteW().
   The added "W", as explained in the DLL import chapter, stands for
   "Wide characters", meaning the Unicode version.  We always have to
   use the "W" version in Javascript calls.
</p>
<div class="code">
let Shell32 = dllImport.bind("Shell32.dll", `
    HINSTANCE ShellExecuteW(
        HWND    hwnd,
        LPCWSTR lpOperation,
        LPCWSTR lpFile,
        LPCWSTR lpParameters,
        LPCWSTR lpDirectory,
        INT     nShowCmd
    );
`);
</div>

<p>
   Now that we have our DLL import defined, we can flesh out the
   "TO DO" code in the event handler prototype we wrote earlier.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == runCustomProgCommand) {
        // run the command
        let result = Shell32.ShellExecuteW(null, "open",
            "c:\\Path\\MyProgram.exe", " /option1 /option2",
            "c:\\Path", SW_SHOW);

        // The result of ShellExecute() is a fake handle value that we
        // have to interpret as an integer to make sense of.  A value
        // higher than 32 indicates success; a value 32 or lower is an
        // error code.  See the Windows SDK documentation for details.
        if (result.toNumber() > 32)
        {
            // success!  do any follow-up here
        }
        else
        {
            // launch failed
            mainWindow.message("Program launch failed (code " + result.toNumber() + ")", "error");
        }
    }
});
</div>

<h2>Using CreateProcess()</h2>

<p>
   For the sake of completeness, let's look at how you'd do
   the same thing using CreateProcess() instead of ShellExecute().
   You can skip all of this if ShellExecute() meets your
   needs, but I wanted to provide the details on how to use
   CreateProcess() just in case you need its extra power.
</p>
<p>
   As before, the first step is to bind the DLL function:
</p>
<div class="code">
let Kernel32 = dllImport.bind("Kernel32.dll", `
    typedef struct _STARTUPINFO {
        DWORD  cb;
        LPWSTR lpReserved;
        LPWSTR lpDesktop;
        LPWSTR lpTitle;
        DWORD  dwX;
        DWORD  dwY;
        DWORD  dwXSize;
        DWORD  dwYSize;
        DWORD  dwXCountChars;
        DWORD  dwYCountChars;
        DWORD  dwFillAttribute;
        DWORD  dwFlags;
        WORD   wShowWindow;
        WORD   cbReserved2;
        BYTE  *lpReserved2;
        HANDLE hStdInput;
        HANDLE hStdOutput;
        HANDLE hStdError;
    } STARTUPINFO, *LPSTARTUPINFO;
    
    typedef struct _PROCESS_INFORMATION {
        HANDLE hProcess;
        HANDLE hThread;
        DWORD  dwProcessId;
        DWORD  dwThreadId;
    } PROCESS_INFORMATION, *PPROCESS_INFORMATION, *LPPROCESS_INFORMATION;

    typedef struct _SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES {
        DWORD  nLength;
        LPVOID lpSecurityDescriptor;
        BOOL   bInheritHandle;
    } SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, *PSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES, *LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES;

    BOOL WINAPI CreateProcessW(
      LPCWSTR               lpApplicationName,
      LPWSTR                lpCommandLine,
      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,
      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,
      BOOL                  bInheritHandles,
      DWORD                 dwCreationFlags,
      LPVOID                lpEnvironment,
      LPCWSTR               lpCurrentDirectory,
      LPSTARTUPINFO         lpStartupInfo,
      LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation
    );

    BOOL WINAPI CloseHandle(HANDLE hObject);
`);
</div>
<p>
   As you can see, CreateProcess() has a bunch of additional arguments you
   have to provide (including several structure definitions).  That's
   where its extra power comes from, as well as the extra headaches
   using it.
</p>
<p>
   Now let's change the command handler to use CreateProcess() to
   do the launch.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == runCustomProgCommand) {
        // create our STARTUPINFOW and PROCESS_INFORMATION structs
        let processInfo = dllImport.create("PROCESS_INFORMATION");
        let startupInfo = dllImport.create("STARTUPINFO");

        // We have to fill in the STARTUPINFO struct with some minimal
        // information.  You can also populate the other fields if you
        // want to set specific options.  By default, Javascript will
        // set everything to zeros and nulls, so you'll get the default
        // options without filling in anything else here.
        startupInfo.cb = dllImport.sizeof("STARTUPINFO");

        // Launch the process.  Fortunately, we can provide "null"
        // parameters to get the defaults for some of the more
        // obscure items, such as the "security attributes".  If
        // you need to set any of the options we've defaulted, you'd
        // just change the corresponding nulls or zeroes to supply
        // the specific options you want to set.
        if (Kernel32.CreateProcessW(
            null, "\"c:\\Path\\MyProgram.exe\" /option1 /option2",
            null, null, false, 0, null, "c:\\Path", startupInfo, processInfo);
        {
            // Success!
            //
            // CreateProcess() will have filled in our PROCESS_INFORMATION
            // struct with handles for the new process and thread.  It's
            // VERY important to close these handles (or ANY handles that
            // Windows creates for us) when we're done with them, because
            // otherwise we'd "leak" these system resources, which could
            // eventually make the program crash if we did if often
            // enough.  Javascript can't close native Windows handles
            // for us automatically, because it doesn't have enough
            // information to know where else they might be used.  So
            // we MUST do this explicitly.
            //
            // If we wanted to interact with the new process later (for
            // example, to monitor it for completion), we could hang onto
            // the process and/or thread handle in a global variable
            // instead of closing them immediately here.  That would let
            // us access the handles later.  But that makes things a bit
            // trickier, because it's still important that we *eventually*
            // close the handles.  In cases where you don't need them
            // later, it's best to close them immediately, so that you
            // don't have to worry about losing track of them.
            Kernel32.CloseHandle(processInfo.hProcess);
            Kernel32.CloseHandle(processInfo.hThread);
        }
        else
        {
            // something went wrong
            mainWin.message("Something went wrong launching the program!", "error");
        }
    }
});
