<h1>KeyEvent</h1>

<p>
   This Event subclass represents keyboard events.  These events
   let you know when the user presses and releases keys on the keyboard,
   and when keys auto-repeat when being held down.  These are
   essentially the unfiltered keyboard events directly from Windows,
   and they're passed to the Javascript event listeners before PinballY
   itself processes the keystrokes, so you can use these events to
   change the way PinballY sees and responds to key presses.
</p>

<p>
   The basic keyboard event type comes in the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <a name="keydown"></a>
   <li><b>keydown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a key while the
   program is running in the foreground.  Also fires each time a key
   "auto-repeats" while the user is holding it down.

   <a name="keyup"></a>
   <li><b>keyup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a key while the
   application is in the foreground.

   <a name="keybgdown"></a>
   <li><b>keybgdown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a key while the
   program is running in the background, and fires again each time the
   key auto-repeats while the user holds the key down.

   <a name="keybgup"></a>
   <li><b>keybgup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a key while the
   application is in the background.
</ul>

<p>
   Keyboard events are always fired on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object.
</p>

<p>
   Note that key events are specifically for keyboard keys.  Joystick
   button presses generate a similar but separate set of events, since
   joystick buttons are described by somewhat different metadata from
   that used for keyboard keys.
   See <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a> for
   details on the joystick events.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the application was in the background when
       the event occurred, false if not.  PinballY processes key presses
       that occur while it's in the background so that it can monitor
       "Exit Game" and "Pause Game" command keys while a game is running.
   <li><b>code:</b> A string representing the key pressed, using the same
       naming as in standard Web browser keydown messages.  See, for
       example, the Mozilla documentation for
       <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code/code_values">KeyboardEvent code values</a>.
       Key codes are <b>not</b> affected by any modifier key status
       (Shift, Ctrl, CapsLock, etc), so this tells you the actual key pressed,
       independently of what modifier keys might also be pressed.  For
       example, pressing the "2" key (on the main keyboard) always yields
       a <b>code</b> value of "Digit2", even when the Shift key is pressed.
   <li><b>key:</b> A string representing the key pressed, using the same
       format used in Web browser keydown messages.  For printable characters,
       this is the character itself, with the modifier key state (Shift, CapsLock,
       NumLock) applied.  For example, holding down the Shift key and pressing
       the "2" key (on the main keyboard) produces a keydown event with <b>key</b>
       set to "@".  For special characters (cursor keys,
       F-keys, etc), this uses the standard browser name for the key, usually
       the same name as in <b>code</b>.
   <li><b>location:</b>  A keyboard location code for the key:
   <ul>
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD (0), standard location used by most keys
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_LEFT (1), the left key of a paired modifier key (Shift, Control, Alt, Meta)
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT (2), the right key of a pair modifier key
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD (3), the numeric keypad
   </ul>

   <li><b>repeat:</b>  true if this is an auto-repeat key event from a key being held down, false if not

   <li><b>repeatCount:</b>  Indicates the number of times this key
   press has been auto-repeated so far while the user is holding the
   key down.  This is 0 (zero) on the initial key press, 1 on
   the first auto-repeat event, 2 on the second auto-repeat, etc.
   Note that <b>repeatCount</b> is always 0 when <b>repeat</b> is
   false, and non-zero when <b>repeatCount</b> is true, so in a way
   this contains the same information as <b>repeat</b>, just with
   the added detail of the number of repeats so far during the
   current key press.

   <li><b>vkey:</b>  A number representing the Windows "virtual key code" value for the key

</ul>

<p>
   Note that the common Web browser "which", "keyCode", and "charCode" properties
   are all missing.  That's because these were always problematic and poorly
   defined.  I didn't want to add to that mess with yet another ad hoc
   variation.  All modern browsers have  moved to the better-defined "code" and
   "key" system, which provides more complete and consistent information.
   The PinballY-specific "vkey" value is provided in case you need
   the low-level Windows event information for some reason, such as for
   directly calling a Windows API function.
</p>



<h2>Background key events</h2>
<p>
   The "bg" key events are used when the application is running
   in the background, meaning that some other application's window
   is activated (that is, the other application's window in the
   foreground and has keyboard focus).  PinballY monitors the keyboard
   while it's in the background so that it can carry out commands
   that operate on a running game, such as "End Game" and "Pause Game".
</p>
<p>
   We use separate Javascript events for foreground and background
   key presses for two reasons.  The first is to simplify your
   event handlers.  In most cases, you won't want to do anything
   at all with background key events, so using separate event types
   for the two cases lets you skip extra checks for the foreground
   or background status.  You can simply write all of your foreground
   key handler code in a foreground key handler function, knowing
   that that function will only be called for foreground keys.
   The second reason is that it reduces the performance overhead
   for processing the background events, by entirely skipping
   user-written event handler code
   that only needs to run for foreground keys.  It's especially
   important to minimize PinballY's performance impact while it's
   in the background so that it doesn't slow down a running game.
   (The performance impact when no event handler is present is
   negligible: in the absence of a user-written event
   handler, the basic processing to fire a background keyboard
   event takes on the order of 100&mu;s.)
</p>
<p>
   If you want to write a single handler that operates on both
   foreground and background key events, the Event Target on()
   method makes that easy: just specify both event types when
   adding the handler:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown keybgdown", (ev) => { /* common handler */ });
</div>

<p>
   It's not possible to use the background key event handlers
   to change or block keystrokes that the foreground application
   receives.  PinballY receives background keys via the Windows
   RAW INPUT mechanism, which only <i>monitors</i> the keys.
   It's essentially a passive wire-tap.
   Windows sends the keystrokes to the foreground application
   regardless of what PinballY does with the events from its
   background handler.
