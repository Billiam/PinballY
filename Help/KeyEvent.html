<h1>KeyEvent</h1>

<p>
   This is the Event subclass that represents keyboard events.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>keydown:</b>  Fires when the user presses a key.  Also fires each
      time a key "auto-repeats" while the user is holding it down.

   <li><b>keyup:</b>  Fires when the user releases a key.
</ul>

<p>
   Keyboard events are always fired on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   object.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the application was in the background when
       the event occurred, false if not.  PinballY processes key presses
       that occur while it's in the background so that it can monitor
       "Exit Game" and "Pause Game" command keys while a game is running.
   <li><b>code:</b> A string representing the key pressed, using the same
       naming as in standard Web browser keydown messages.  See, for
       example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values">Key Values (MDN)</a>.
   <li><b>key:</b> A string representing the key pressed, using the same
       format used in Web browser keydown messages.  For printable characters,
       this is the character itself, with shift key status applied (e.g.,
       holding down shift and pressing the "2" key produces a keydown event
       with key set to "@").  For special characters (cursor keys, F-keys, etc),
       this uses the standard browser name for the key, usually the same
       name as in <b>code</b>.
   <li><b>location:</b>  A keyboard location code for the key:
   <ul>
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD (0), standard location used by most keys
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_LEFT (1), the left key of a paired modifier key (Shift, Control, Alt, Meta)
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT (2), the right key of a pair modifier key
      <li>KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD (3), the numeric keypad
   </ul>
   <li><b>repeat:</b>  true if this is an auto-repeat key event from a key being held down, false if not
   <li><b>vkey:</b>  A number representing the Windows "virtual key code" value for the key
</ul>

<p>
   Note that the common Web browser "which", "keyCode", and "charCode" properties
   are all missing.  That's because these were always problematic and poorly
   defined.  I didn't want to add to that mess with yet another ad hoc
   variation.  All modern browsers have  moved to the better-defined "code" and
   "key" system, which provides more complete and consistent information.
   The PinballY-specific "vkey" value is provided in case you really want
   the low-level Windows event information, but you'd really be better off
   in nearly all cases using the code and/or key values.
</p>
