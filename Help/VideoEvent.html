<h1>VideoEvent</h1>

<p>
   Events of this class are fired at certain points in video playback.
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>videoend:</b>  Fired when the video reaches the end of its playback.
   If the video is looping, this fires each time the video reaches the end
   and restarts.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a> object where the video is
   playing.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   Video events include all of the standard event properties and methods (see the
   <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>looping:</b>  A boolean specifying whether the video is playing back
   on a loop (true) or as a single play (false).
</ul>

</body>
