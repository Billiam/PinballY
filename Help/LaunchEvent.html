<h1>LaunchEvent</h1>

<p>
   Events of this class are fired to track the progress of a game session
   when the user launches a table.  This event has the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>prelaunch:</b>  Fired just before a game is about to be launched.
   This event occurs before any part of the launch process begins, so
   you can cancel the event (via <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>)
   to prevent the launch.

   <li><b>gamestarted:</b>  Fired when PinballY detects that the launched
   game has successfully started and opened a window.  The exact timing of
   the event isn't predictable, since the game program runs as a separate
   Windows process.  You can count on the event firing some time after
   the game has opened a window, but you shouldn't assume that the event
   fires before any particular point in the game's startup.  This event
   can't be canceled, since it's fired after the fact.

   <li><b>gameover:</b>  Fired after PinballY detects that the child
   game process has terminated, and before any of the post-launch tasks
   (such as the game system's "Run After" commands) have been executed.
   This event can't be canceled, since it's fired after the game process
   has already exited.  (You can prevent PinballY from trying to stop
   the game in the first place, by blocking the "Kill Game" command via
   the <a href="CommandEvent.html">command</a> event.  That obviously
   doesn't prevent the game process from exiting on its own, or from
   the user taking an external action outside of PinballY that ends the
   game process, such as closing its window with the mouse or killing
   the process via Task Manager.  The <b>gameover</b> event fires
   regardless of what caused the process to terminate; it's just a
   notification that PinballY detected that the process exited.)

   <li><b>launcherror:</b>  Fired if a game launch fails.  This event
   is mutually exclusive with <b>gamestarted</b> and <b>gameover</b>,
   since those events will only be fired if the game successfully
   starts running; a <b>launcherror</b> event means that the launch
   attempt was unsuccessful, so no further action on the launch will
   occur.  You can cancel this event to prevent the error message
   from being displayed (canceling it has no other effect, though,
   as the event fires after the launch attempt has already failed).

   <li><b>postlaunch:</b>  The counterpart of <b>prelaunch</b> that
   fires at the very end of the launch procedure, after the game
   has exited and all of the "after game" tasks have been completed.

   <li><b>runafter:</b>  Fired after the game has exited, with the
   "Game Exiting" message displayed in the main PinballY window.
   This runs just after the external "Run After" command defined for
   the system runs.  This event can't be canceled.

   <li><b>runafterpost:</b>  Fired after the <b>runafter</b> event
   completes and the main PinballY window is blanked.  This event
   cannot be canceled.

   <li><b>runbefore:</b>  Fired just before the game program is
   launched, with the main PinballY window displaying the "Loading
   Game" message.  Canceling this event aborts the launch.

   <li><b>runbeforepre:</b>  Fired before the <b>runbefore</b>
   event, with the main PinballY window showing a blank, black
   background.  Canceling this event aborts the launch.
</ul>

<p>
   The <b>runbeforepre</b>, <b>runbefore</b>, <b>runafter</b>, and
   <b>runafterpost</b> events run in that order, and correspond to the
   similarly named external commands that can be set up for each system
   in the options.  The separate "pre" and "post" events are provided
   for finer control over the display appearance during each step.
   During the <b>runbeforepre</b> and <b>runafterpost</b> commands, the
   main PinballY window is blank, showing just a uniform black
   background.  This makes it a good time to perform any changes
   to the physical monitor layout, such as rotating the monitors or
   changing the screen resolutions, since the blank window won't
   show any obvious visual effect and thus will help achieve
   a visually seamless transition to the new layout.
</p>
<p>
   The full order of the events, including the external commands, is
   as follows:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>prelaunch</b> fires
   <li>The main PinballY window is blanked
   <li>The game system's external "Run Before Pre" command runs
   <li><b>runbeforepre</b> fires
   <li>The "Loading Game" message is displayed in the main window
   <li><b>runbefore</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run Before" command runs
   <li>The game launches
   <li><b>gamestarted</b> fires
   <li>The game runs until the user quits
   <li>The "Game Exiting" message is displayed in the main window
   <li><b>gameover</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run After" command runs
   <li><b>runafter</b> fires
   <li>The main window is blanked
   <li><b>runafterpost</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run After Post" command runs
   <li><b>postlaunch</b> fires
</ul>
<p>
   The sequence above is for successful launches.  It will vary
   slightly if anything goes wrong.  If the game system launch itself
   fails (for example, if the game program can't be started, or if it
   terminates or crashes before opening a UI window), a <b>launcherror</b>
   event will be fired instead of <b>gamestarted</b> and <b>gameover</b>.
   The sequence can also be cut short if the "Run Before" commands fail.
   Errors in those steps will prevent the game from being launched,
   although the system does try to run the paired "Run After" routines
   in all cases to ensure that any global changes made in the "Run Before"
   steps are undone by the matching "Run After" steps.

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event has the standard event properties and methods (see the
   <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>command:</b>  The <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a> of the
   command used to launch the game, typically command.PlayGame or
   command.CaptureGo.

   <li><b>error:</b>  For a <b>launcherror</b> event only, this is a string
   describing the error.  This message is normally displayed to the user
   via a popup message, but you can prevent that by canceling the event.

   <li><b>game:</b>  A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object describing
   the game being launched.

   <li><a name="overrideProperties"></a><b>overrides:</b>
   For <b>prelaunch</b> only, this is initially set to
   an empty object.  Event listeners can set properties of this object to
   override the normal launch parameters taken from the game system's
   settings in the options.  The following properties can be set:

   <ul>
      <li><b>envVars:</b>  Windows environment variables to pass to the
      game process.  This is a string with one or more variables, separated
      by semicolons (";"), with each variable using the format NAME=VALUE.
      If specified, this completely replaces the environment variables
      defined in the system settings, so if you want to keep those
      as well, you must explicitly include them in this property.
      
      <li><b>exe:</b>  A string giving the full filename with absolute path
      of the program executable (.EXE) to launch.
      
      <li><b>params:</b>  A string giving the command-line parameters to
      pass to the program executable.  This can contain the usual expansion
      variables in [square brackets]; see <a href="SystemOptions.html#parameters">Parameters</a>
      in the System Options dialog for the list of variables.

      <li><b>processName:</b>  A string giving the name of the process to
      monitor to determine when the game has terminated.

      <li><b>runAfter:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run After command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runAfterPost:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run After Post command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runBefore:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run Before command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runBeforePre:</b>   A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Before Pre command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>swShow:</b>  An integer value giving the initial window mode;
      typically SW_SHOW, SW_SHOWMINIMIZED, or SW_HIDE.

      <li><b>terminateBy:</b>  A string giving the termination mode for the
      program; see <a href="GameSysInfo.html#terminateBy">terminateBy</a>
      in the GameSysInfo object.

      <li><b>workingPath:</b>  A string giving the full absolute path to use
      as the working directory for the game process.
      
   </ul>

</ul>
