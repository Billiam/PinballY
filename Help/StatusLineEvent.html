<h1>StatusLineEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when one of the status line messages is about
   to change.  (The status line is the area near the bottom of the main
   window where a rotating series of messages are displayed.)
</p>
<p>
   This event has only one subtype:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>statusline:</b> Fires when a status line message is about to change.
   This event isn't cancelable, but you can change the text to be displayed
   by assigning a new value to the <b>expandedText</b> property of the event.
</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>

<h2>Triggers</h2>

<p>
   The <b>statusline</b> event can be triggered in two different ways:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>By the normal timed rotation through the different messages
   assigned to the the status line.  Each message is displayed for a
   fixed amount of time (configured in the settings), and when the
   time is up, the system automatically switches to the next message
   in the rotation.  The <b>statusline</b> event is fired each time one
   of these routine timed updates occurs.

   <li>By a change to something else in the PinballY environment that
   affects or could affect one of the status line substitution variables.
   PinballY re-evaluates the text of each current status line message to
   check for changes to the text whenever something changes in the environment,
   such as switching to a new game on the wheel or selecting a different
   filter.  When the program detects a change in the expanded text, it
   immediately updates the displayed text to match, firing this event
   in the process.
</ul>


<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following
   additional items:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>expandedText:</b> a string containing the expanded text for
   the new message that's being displayed.  This is the result of
   replacing any substitution variables in the source text with their
   current values.  See <a href="StatuslineOptions.html#substVars">Statusline Options</a>
   for a list of the substitution variables.
   <p>
      If you assign a new value to <b>expandedText</b>, the program
      will display your new value in place of the expanded text it was
      going to display.
   </p>

   <li><b>sourceText:</b>  a string containing the source text for the
   new message that's being displayed.  This is the raw text specified
   in the settings, before replacing substitution variables with
   their current values.  See <a href="StatuslineOptions.html">Statusline Options</a>
   for more on setting up the messages to be displayed.

   <li><b>which:</b>  a string identifying which part of the status line
   is being updated:

   <ul>
      <li>"upper": the upper line of the main status line
      <li>"lower": the lower line of the main status line
      <li>"attract": the single status line shown in attract mode
   </ul>
</ul>
