<h1>Game Wheel Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide unconfigured games:</b>
   Check this box if you don't want unconfigured games to be displayed
   in the main game wheel list by default.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY always searches the "Tables" folder for each system to find
   all game files, whether or not you've set up the bibliographic information
   (title, manufacturer, year) and whether or not you've added any media
   items for the game.  Normally, PinballY shows all of these files in
   the game wheel list.  Games that haven't been configured yet are easy
   to spot because they use default background images and just show the
   raw filename in place of a title.
</p>
<p>
   The point of showing the unconfigured items in the main list is
   to make setup easier, by letting you see at a glance exactly which
   games need your attention in terms of entering bibliography data
   or downloading media.  However, you might prefer to hide these
   when you're just playing, or when you're showing off your cab
   to friends.  Check this box to keep them out of the main list.
</p>
<p>
   When the box is checked, you can still view all of the unconfigured
   games at any time, by selecting "Show Unconfigured Games" from the
   Operator Menu.  That switches to a filtered list showing only the
   unconfigured items.
</p>
<p>
   Note you can also explicitly hide individual games, using the
   "Hide Game" command in the Game Setup menu (reachable from the
   Operator Menu).  You can use this to remove listings for files
   that you don't even intend to set up in the future, such as old
   backup copies or testing copies.

   <b>Underlay sizing:</b>  These settings control the layout of the
   <a href="Underlay.html">underlay</a> image.  All of these sizes are
   expressed as percentages of the window height.  You can enter the
   values with "%" signs, and they're shown that way for clarity,
   but the "%" signs aren't required; it doesn't affect the interpretation
   if they're omitted.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Height:</b>  The height of the underlay image.  The underlay
   typically is designed to cover only the bottom portion of the window,
   roughly in the same area where the game wheel icons are displayed.

   <li><b>Distance from bottom of window:</b>  This is normally zero,
   which means that the bottom of the underlay image is exactly aligned
   with the bottom of the window.  If you want to move the image up
   or down to align it differently, you can enter a percentage value
   here.  A positive value moves the image upwards on the screen, and
   a negative value moves it downwards (which will of course cut off
   some of the image at the bottom, since a portion will be below
   the bottom of the window).

   <li><b>Maximum width:</b>  The maximum width of the image.  The
   underlay is normally stretched out to exactly match the width of
   the window, but you can set a cap on how far it can be stretched
   with this setting.  It won't be stretched out any wider than this.
   <p>
      As with the other values, this is a percentage of the <b>height</b>
      of the window, so it effectively sets a maximum "aspect ratio"
      for the image.  That is, it sets a limit on how far the image can
      be distorted by horizontal stretching.
   </p>
   <p>
      The default setting for this value is an extremely large value,
      chosen to be large enough that it'll never be reached in practice.
      That makes it effectively an "infinity" setting, which is to
      say, no maximum cap at all.
   </p>
   <p>
      Why would you want to use this?  It's mostly for people who are
      running in "landscape" mode, like on a typical desktop PC, where
      the main monitor is oriented so that it's wider than it is tall.
      Pin cab users usually do the opposite - "portrait" mode, where
      the main monitor is turned so that it's taller than it is wide.
      In landscape mode, a normally proportioned playfield image only
      fills a narrow area in the middle of the screen, so stretching
      the underlay image to the full width would make it ridiculously
      stretched out.  The maximum width lets you maintain a more
      appropriate aspect ratio.  If you're using landscape mode,
      you might want to try a setting around 56.25% (9/16), since that
      will keep the image proportioned about the same as a typical
      playfield image.
