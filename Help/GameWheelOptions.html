<h1>Game Wheel Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide unconfigured games:</b>
   Check this box if you don't want unconfigured games to be displayed
   in the main game wheel list by default.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY always searches the "Tables" folder for each system to find
   all game files, whether or not you've set up the bibliographic information
   (title, manufacturer, year) and whether or not you've added any media
   items for the game.  Normally, PinballY shows all of these files in
   the game wheel list.  Games that haven't been configured yet are easy
   to spot because they use default background images and just show the
   raw filename in place of a title.
</p>
<p>
   The point of showing the unconfigured items in the main list is
   to make setup easier, by letting you see at a glance exactly which
   games need your attention in terms of entering bibliography data
   or downloading media.  However, you might prefer to hide these
   when you're just playing, or when you're showing off your cab
   to friends.  Check this box to keep them out of the main list.
</p>
<p>
   When the box is checked, you can still view all of the unconfigured
   games at any time, by selecting "Show Unconfigured Games" from the
   Operator Menu.  That switches to a filtered list showing only the
   unconfigured items.
</p>
<p>
   Note you can also explicitly hide individual games, using the
   "Hide Game" command in the Game Setup menu (reachable from the
   Operator Menu).  You can use this to remove listings for files
   that you don't even intend to set up in the future, such as old
   backup copies or testing copies.
