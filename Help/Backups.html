<h1>Backing up your files</h1>

<p>
   It's always a good idea to make backup copies of your hard disk,
   in case you ever have a hardware failure or software problem that
   requires replacing or reformatting your hard disk.
</p>
<p>
   My first recommendation would be to use a good backup program or
   disk imaging program that saves everything on your system.  I
   consider that to be the safest approach, because it guarantees
   that you won't accidentally forget something important.
</p>
<p>
   But some people prefer to do manual backups, in which case you'll
   want to know which PinballY files you need to back up.  Or, there
   might be times when you just want to create a snapshot of
   your full PinballY setup.  So for those situations, here's a list
   of all of the files needed to re-create your PinballY setup:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Settings.txt</b> in the main PinballY folder (stores
   all of your program option settings)

   <li><b>GameStats.csv</b> in the main PinballY folder (stores
   portions of the game metadata)

   <li>Your entire <b>Media</b> folder tree

   <li>Your entire <b>Databases</b> folder tree
</ul>

<p>
   The <b>Media</b> and <b>Databases</b> folder locations depend on
   your option settings.  See <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>
   for full details, but here's the quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If you're using the "Share with PinballX" option, both folders
   will be in your PinballX install folder

   <li>If you're not sharing with PinballX, both folders will be in
   your PinballY install folder by default

   <li>However, you can override the default locations in the settings -
   if you're not sure, the <b>Folders</b> page in the options dialog
   will show you the current settings
</ul>

<p>
   PinballY doesn't store any settings in the registry, so you don't
   need to worry about that.  (Many other programs do use registry
   settings to store user information, though, which is one of the
   reasons I think it's a good idea to use a proper backup program
   or disk imaging program, rather than making backups manually.
   A "real" backup program will usually include a full capture
   of the registry as an automatic part of the backup set.)
</p>
<p>
   You don't need to back up the PinballY program files
   themselves, since you can always just do a fresh install to
   re-create those.  But if you're not on a tight space budget for your
   backup media, the simplest thing is to just make a copy of
   your entire PinballY folder tree (plus your complete PinballX
   folder tree, if you're sharing media with PinballX).
</p>

<h2>Recommended backup practices</h2>

<p>
   This has nothing to do with PinballY, but as long as we're on the
   subject, I can't resist the urge to make some recommendations
   about backup practices in general.  I see too many
   posts on the forums from people who had to re-build their
   systems from scratch after a hard disk failure or Windows
   crash.  It's clear that a lot of people skip backups for
   their pin cabs.  Don't be one of them!
</p>
<p>
   Here are some key things I'd look for in a backup setup:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>It should be <b>automatic</b>.  It should run on a schedule
   so that you don't have to remember to run it yourself.  If
   you have to run it manually, chances are that you won't think
   about it for long stretches.

   <li>The media should be <b>remote</b> - not physically
   connected computer you're backing up.  Ideally, it should be
   off-site in a cloud service, since that gives you complete
   physical isolation.  At the very
   least, it should be on an external hard disk that you don't
   keep connected to the machine, or on a separate computer
   on your home network.  A hardware failure or Windows crash
   could corrupt every disk connected to the computer, and
   a malware attack could trash every connected disk.  Physical
   isolation is the only way to be sure the backup media are
   safe against whatever disaster hits the subject system.

   <li>It should be <b>versioned</b>.  Versioning is critical
   for malware protection - if you discover an infection or
   lose everything in a ransomware attack, it'll do you no good
   to have a backup copy of the infected files.  You'll need to
   be able to go back in time to an earlier version before the
   infection.  Versioning is also an extremely nice safety net
   when you're making configuration changes, because it lets
   you go back in time to an earlier working setup if you mess
   something up.

   <li>It should do a whole-disk scan.  If you have to manually
   choose the files that get backed up, you'll inevitably miss
   something important.

   <li>It should include the Windows registry as part of the
   backup, since Windows itself and many application programs
   store a lot of important configuration data there.
</ul>
