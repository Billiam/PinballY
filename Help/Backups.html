<h1>Backing up your files</h1>

<p>
   Some people have asked for a list of all of the files you'd need to copy if
   you wanted to manually back up your full PinballY setup, including
   all of the media files and table information databases.  Here's
   what you should save:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Settings.txt</b> in the main PinballY folder (stores
   all of your program option settings).  The location
   of this file can be explicitly changed by a
   <a href="CommandLine.html">command line option</a>, /Settings,
   when launching PinballY.

   <li><b>GameStats.csv</b> in the main PinballY folder (stores
   portions of the game metadata).  The location
   of this file can be explicitly changed by a
   <a href="CommandLine.html">command line option</a>, /GameStats,
   when launching PinballY.

   <li>Your entire <b>Media</b> folder tree

   <li>Your entire <b>Databases</b> folder tree

   <li>Registry settings: None (PinballY doesn't store any settings
   in the registry)
</ul>

<p>
   The <b>Media</b> and <b>Databases</b> folder locations depend on
   your option settings.  You might want to read
   <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>
   for full details, but here's the quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If you're using the "Share with PinballX" option, both folders
   will be in your PinballX install folder

   <li>If you're not sharing with PinballX, both folders will be in
   your PinballY install folder by default

   <li>However, you can override the default locations in the settings -
   if you're not sure, the <b>Folders</b> page in the options dialog
   will show you the current settings
</ul>

<p>
   You don't need to back up the PinballY program files
   themselves, since you can always just do a fresh install to
   re-create those.  But if you're not on a tight space budget for your
   backup media, the simplest thing is to just make a copy of
   your entire PinballY folder tree (plus your complete PinballX
   folder tree, if you're sharing media with PinballX).
