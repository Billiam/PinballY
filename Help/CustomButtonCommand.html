<h1>Custom Button Command</h1>
<p>
<p>
   PinballY's user interface is designed to be fully operable with just
   the basic set of four buttons that are pretty much mandatory for
   any pin cab just to play simulated pinball games: the flipper buttons,
   the Start button, and an Exit button.  That minimalism in the UI
   design ensures that all functions are accessible even on virtually
   any cab, even with the bare minimum of buttons.
</p>
<p>
   But if you're not so minimalist, and your cab has a bunch of extra
   buttons beyond the core four, you probably want to put them to some
   use.  PinballY lets you map a number of commands beyond the
   minimal set through the <a href="ButtonOptions.html">Button Options</a>
   page in the settings, but that dialog doesn't include every possible
   command in the program.  Fortunately, there is a way to go beyond
   the fixed set of commands available in the settings dialog and
   map almost any button to almost any command.  I'm sure you already
   guessed what it is: Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   Mapping a button to a command through Javascript is a simple matter of
   combining two Javascript capabilities:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="KeyEvent.html">Keyboard events</a> and
   <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">Joystick button events</a>, which let you
   intercept button presses and program custom actions in response

   <li><a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>, which let you execute program
   commands from scripting code
</ul>

<h2>Keyboard key handlers</h2>
<p>
   The basic code template for mapping a keyboard key to a custom command
   looks like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown", ev => {
    if (ev.code == "F7") {
        mainWindow.doCommand(command.Flyer);
        ev.preventDefault();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   This creates an event listener for the <b>keydown</b> event, which fires
   each time a key is pressed.  The listener checks which key was actually
   pressed by looking at the <b>code</b> property in the event descriptor
   object (the variable <b>ev</b>) that PinballY passes to the event handler
   when firing the event.  The <b>code</b> value is a string that identifies
   which key was pressed, using a standard set of key names that most
   Internet browsers use in their Javascript event system.  For this
   example, we used the function key F7.  You can find out more about the
   available keys and their code strings in the <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a>
   section.
</p>
<p>
   If the key matches the one we're looking for, the event handler calls
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doCommand"><b>mainWindow.doCommand()</b></a>
   to carry out the command.  For this example, we're executing the
   "Flyer" command, which shows the current game's flyer.
   See the <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>
   section for a full list of the available command codes.
</p>
<p>
   The final step in the event handler calls <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>
   on the event descriptor object, which cancels any built-in handling the
   system would have applied to the key event after the Javascript handler
   returns.  This isn't really necessary for keys that aren't mapped to
   other functions already, since PinballY's built-in handling for unmapped
   keys is simply to ignore them, but I still think it's a good idea because
   it prevents any surprises should the key take on a default meaning in
   some future PinballY version.
</p>

<h2>Joystick button presses</h2>
<p>
   The template for a joystick button handler is almost exactly the same
   as for keyboard keys.  We just listen for the <b>joystickbuttondown</b>
   event instead of the <b>keydown</b> event.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("joystickbuttondown", ev => {
    if (ev.button == 7) {
        mainWindow.doCommand(command.Flyer);
        ev.preventDefault();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   Joystick buttons are identified by their button number, so here we're
   looking for joystick button #7.  That will match button #7 on any joystick
   device.  If you have more than one joystick device in your system, you
   might want to also test for the "unit" number to distinguish your
   different devices.  See <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a>
   for more details.
</p>


<h2>Customizing the examples</h2>
<p>
   To adapt this example to any other keyboard key, simply pick out which
   key you want to map, and replace the "F7" key code in the example with
   the key code for the key you want to map.  See the <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a>
   section for details on how to identify the different keyboard keys.
</p>
<p>
   To adapt it to other joystick buttons, pick out the joystick button
   you want to use and change the button test to match.  See the
   <a href="JoystickEvent.html">JoystickEvent</a> section for details
   on how to identify the joystick buttons.
</p>
<p>
   To fire a different command, change the command ID used in the call to
   <b>mainWindow.doCommand()</b> to the one you want to execute instead.
   See <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> for the full list of available
   command codes.
</p>

<h2>Multiple key command handlers</h2>
<p>
   You can set up as many custom keyboard key and joystick button handlers
   along these lines as you like.  There are two ways to handle multiple
   button customizations:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>You can create a separate handler for each button, following the
   same templates shown above.  This is the best way if you want to keep the
   customizations separate, since each handler stands on its own.

   <li>You can add <b>else if</b> tests within the templates above to
   test for different keys/buttons.  That's a little more efficient
   than using a separate handler per button, because it doesn't require
   the overhead of a separate function call for each button.  It has
   the downside of tangling up the code for the different buttons,
   though.
</ul>
