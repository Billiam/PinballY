<h1>High Scores</h1>

<p>
   PinballY automatically displays the "live" high score information
   for the currently selected game.  The high scores are displayed
   in the video DMD window and on the real DMD device, if you have
   one. 
</p>
<p>
   Scores are displayed in rotation with the game's regular
   background media for the DMD window or device.  If you've supplied
   a static image for the DMD, the image will be displayed for about
   7 seconds at a time, and then the high scores will be displayed,
   then the image will be displayed again, etc.  If the game has a
   DMD video, the video will be displayed all the way through, then
   the scores will be displayed, then the video will play again,
   and so on.
</p>

<h2>How PinballY reads high scores, part I: PINemHI</h2>
<p>
   For most games, PinballY uses a separate program called
   <a href="http://www.pinemhi.com/">PINemHi</a>, written by vpforums member DnaDisturber.
   (PINemHi is included in the PinballY distribution with the author's
   permission, so there's no need to install it separately.)
</p>
<p>
   PINemHi reads special files known as NVRAM (for Non-Volatile RAM) files.
   These are created by Visual Pinball (more technically, by VPinMAME) and
   by Future Pinball when you play games through those systems, and they
   store information that the simulated pinball machines would have stored
   in real life in their on-board memory chips.  The stored information
   includes things like operator settings (for example, whether or not
   the game is in Free Play mode, how many balls per game it's configured
   to use, and so on) and audit counts (how many times the game has
   been played, how many coins it's collected), as well as the latest
   high scores.  PINemHi is programmed to parse the NVRAM files for almost
   all of the VPinMAME and Future Pinball games in existence to pick out
   the high score information and format it for display.
</p>
<p>
   PINemHi works with almost all games that use VPinMAME to play back
   original ROMs, and with almost all Future Pinball games.  PINemHi
   doesn't work with Visual Pinball games that don't use ROMs, such as
   original VP creations, and VP re-creations of games from the electromechanical
   (EM) era.  PINemHi also doesn't work for games based on other player
   systems, such as commercial games.
</p>

<h2>How PinballY reads high scores, part II: ad hoc score files</h2>
<p>
   For games that PINemHi doesn't work with, PinballY provides its own
   supplemental way to provide the high scores, using ad hoc score
   files.  This requires specific code to be added to each table to
   write the ad hoc file, so it will only work with tables that have
   been specifically programmed to support it.
</p>
<p>
   Here's how this works:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>PinballY always starts by trying PINemHi.  If that works,
   the PINemHi results are used, skipping the rest of the steps below.

   <li>If PINemHi can't retrieve high scores for the game, PinballY
   looks for a file that has the exact <b>same name and location</b> as the
   <b>table file</b> for the game (for example, the <b>.vpx</b> file
   for a Visual Pinball X game), but with the filename extension
   replaced with <b>.pinballyHighScores</b>.  For example, if the
   table file is <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables\Fireball_v2_7.vpx</tt>,
   PinballY will look for the scores in a file called
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables\Fireball_v2_7.pinballyHighScores</tt>.

   <li>If the high scores file exists, PinballY reads it into memory
   as a plain ASCII text file.  Each line in the file corresponds to
   one line on the DMD high score display.  Blank lines separate
   groups of messages that are shown together on one screen.
</ul>

<h2>Display styles</h2>
<p>
   For the video DMD window, PinballY offers three display styles
   for generated high score graphics, to cover the three main
   display styles used in real pinball machines over the decades:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>DMD style.  This simulates the 128x32 dot matrix display
   used in most machines from the 1990s onwards.  By default, the
   dots are displayed in an amber color simulating the original
   plasma displays in the 1990s machines.  For games with VPinMAME
   ROMs, however, any color customizations you've made in the
   VPinMAME settings will be respected and used instead.  This
   should make the generated high-score screens harmonize with
   captured DMD video.
   
   <li>Alphanumeric style.  This simulates the 16-segment plasma
   LED displays used in most games from the late 1980s.
   
   <li>Typewriter style.  This simulates a paper note card printed
   with the high score information.  This is meant to provide
   something appropriate to the era for electromechanical tables,
   which didn't (usually) have any way to record the high scores
   themselves.  The closest equivalent of a high score display
   for those old machines was for someone to stick a paper note
   to the machine commemorating champion scores.  This format is
   designed to simulate that approach.
</ul>

<p>
   By default, the program picks the display style for each game
   automatically based on the table's metadata, as stored in the
   XML table database.  (You can edit this information via the
   Game Details dialog.)
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Any table with a release year before 1978 uses the Typewriter style,
   since virtually all known games up to that point were EM tables

   <li>A machine with a release year from 1978 to 1990 uses the Alphanumeric style,
   since almost all of the real machines produced during these
   years used either 7-segment numeric displays or 16-segment
   alphanumeric displays

   <li>Any machine with a release year of 1990 or earlier that's set to table type "SS"
   (solid state) in its metadata uses the Alphanumeric style

   <li>A table whose release year is 1991 <i>and</i> whose title is "Funhouse",
   "Harley-Davidson", or "The Machine: Bride of Pinbot" uses the
   Alphanumeric style.  We have to treat these three machines as special
   cases, because 1991 was a transition year that included both Alphanumeric
   and DMD-based machines, so we can't tell which it is based on the year
   alone.  The IPDB table type doesn't help either, since both Alphanumeric and DMD games are
   considered "Solid State".  (In contrast, the transitional years in the late 1970s
   between mechanical score-reel games and digital displays are distinguishable
   by the IPDB table types "EM" and "SS", so those years don't need any
   special title-by-title cases - which is nice, because that transition
   covered several years.)  Fortunately, these three titles are the only
   Alphanumeric games released in 1991 (as far as I know), so we don't need
   a gigantic list of special cases to settle the question, just this short list.

   <li>Anything else uses the DMD style
</ul>

<p>
   You can override the default style on a game-by-game basis in
   the Edit Game Details dialog.  That lets you fix any games that
   the rules above classify in the wrong category, or any that you
   just want to change for other reasons.
</p>
<p>
   The display styles only apply to a <b>video</b> DMD window - that is,
   a regular video monitor that's showing a simulated DMD image in a window.
   If you're using a <b>real</b> DMD device (a physical DMD, such as a PinDMD or a Pin2DMD),
   PinballY just uses a plain "dots" font for high score displays, since
   the dot resolution on those devices is too low to simulate the
   other styles effectively.
</p>
   

<h2>Customizing the "Typewriter" display style</h2>
<p>
   The Typewriter style normally uses an image of an index card
   as the background, with black text in the Courier New font to
   display the score information.  You can customize both of
   these aspects of the display:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>See <a href="TTHighScoreBackgrounds.html">"TT" High Score Backgrounds</a>
   to find out how to change the background image

   <li>The font and text color can be customized using the
   <a href="FontOptions.html">Fonts &amp; Colors</a> section in the Settings dialog
</ul>


<h2>Editing captured DMD video</h2>
<p>
   If you're creating your own DMD video for a game based on 
   captured video from the game's "live" DMD,
   you can get the best effect in PinballY by editing the captured
   video to <b>clip out the portion that shows the high scores</b>.
</p>
<p>
   Most electronic games from the late 1980s onward display a series of
   "attract mode" messages between games, and these usually include
   the high scores.  So if you capture video from the DMD during
   the game's attract mode, it will probably include the high scores.
   Those high scores will be the ones that were current at the time
   you captured the video, though!  If you leave them in the video,
   the video playback will forever show those same scores, even if
   you beat them on later games.  That's why it's best to edit them
   out.
</p>
<p>
   Since PinballY automatically generates graphics with the latest
   high scores from the NVRAM files, and interleaves them with the captured DMD video, you can
   create an almost seamless effect showing the live scores.  The trick
   is to edit the captured video so that it starts just <i>after</i> the
   high scores are displayed in the video, and ends just <i>before</i>
   the high scores are displayed again on the next cycle.  That way,
   PinballY will insert the live high score screens at just the right
   point in the video, simulating the original rotation, but always up
   to date with the latest high scores saved on disk.
</p>

<h2>Customizing high scores through Javascript</h2>
<p>
   The Javascript system includes an event class, <a href="HighScoresEvent.html">HighScoresEvent</a>,
   that lets you intercept PinballY's communications with PINemHi to supplement or
   replace the high scores that PINemHi provides.  This could be used to change
   the format of the high scores for certain games, for example, or to provide
   your own external source of high scores for games that PINemHi doesn't work
   with.  See the event class documentation for more details.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript can also access the high score information that the system has
   retrieved for a game, via <a href="GameInfo.html#getHighScores">gameInfo.getHighScores()</a>.
   For example, you could use that to create custom graphics that incorporate a list of
   high scores.
