<h1>CommandEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event type is fired when the program is about to carry out a
   "command" - a specific program function.  The user can initiate
   commands by selecting items from menus, pressing buttons mapped
   to commands, or by mouse selections (e.g., selecting from a
   right-click context menu).  See <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>
   for a list of the command functions.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   The CommandEvent class has only one subtype:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>command:</b> Fires when a user action triggers a system command.
</ul>

<p>
   As with most event types, a CommandEvent fires before the system carries
   out its normal handling for the command.  This allows you to block a command
   entirely by calling preventDefault() on the event object in your handler.
   For example, if you wanted to prevent the user from being able to exit out
   of PinballY using the menus, you could do something like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.Quit)
        ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>



<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b> The integer identifier of the command.  You can compare this
   to the identifiers defined as properties of the <a href="Commands.html">command</a>
   object.

   <li><b>index:</b>  If the command is part of a ranged group (such as command.FilterFirst
   ... command.FilterLast), this will contain an integer giving the index of the command
   within the group, starting at 0 for the first command of the group.  For a 
   command that isn't part of a range group, the index property isn't present (so
   it will return <b>undefined</b> if read, per normal Javascript rules).

   <li><b>name:</b>  A string giving the name of the command.  The command names
   are the same as the property names of the <a href="Commands.html">command</a> object.
   For "ranged" commands (such as command.FilterFirst ... command.FilterLast), the
   name is always the name of the first command of the range, such as command.FilterFirst,
   and the .index property is set to the index of the command within the range group.
   For example, if <i>event</i>.id == command.FilterFirst + 10, <i>event</i>.name
   will contain "FilterFirst", and <i>event</i>.index will be set to 10.  The index
   is set to zero when the command is the first command of a range group.

</ul>
