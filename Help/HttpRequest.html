<h1>HttpRequest Objects</h1>

<p>
   This class is similar to the standard XmlHttpRequest class in Web
   browsers.  It provides access to network resources via the HTTP
   protocol, using asynchronous requests.
</p>

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<p>
   The HttpRequest object depends upon the Windows MSXML system component.
   This is normally installed as part of the basic Windows installation,
   but as with any component on Windows, it's always possible that it's
   missing due to some past configuration change or setup error.  If you
   get an error ("Required system component MSXML is not installed") when
   trying to create an HttpRequest object, you should be able to correct
   it by installing the latest MSXML from the Microsoft support site.
</p>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<p>
   Other than the slightly different name,
   HttpRequest works <i>mostly</i> like XmlHttpRequest in a browser.
   The main difference is how it handles completion notifications.
   HttpRequest uses the modern Javascript "Promise" mechanism,
   whereas the XmlHttpRequest in browsers uses an older ad hoc event
   handler scheme.
</p>
<p>
   There are four steps to sending a basic HTTP request:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create an HttpRequest object with <tt>new</tt>
   <li>Set up the HTTP verb and URL via the open() method
   <li>Initiate the actual network transaction via the send() method
   <li>Handle the response in a "then" function
</ul>

<p>
   If you've used XmlHttpRequest in a browser, you're already familiar
   with this process.  The first three steps are exactly the same,
   right down to the method names and parameters (apart from the
   the different class name).  The process diverges - very slightly -
   in the final step, where we handle the response.  In a browser,
   you have to set up a callback function <i>before</i> you do the
   send() operation, typically by setting the "onreadystatechange"
   property.  The callback has to monitor the "readyState" property
   of the request object and wait until it changes to the special
   state "4", meaning "done".  Our version is a little simpler and
   nicer, since it's based on the Promise mechanism, which was
   added to Javascript specifically so that there'd be a clean
   and consistent way to handle asynchronous tasks like this.
</p>
<p>
   With HttpRequest, you don't have to set up a state-change
   callback ahead of time.  Instead, the send() method returns
   a Promise object, and you use that to handle the completion event.
   The Promise object is a standard ES6 feature, so you can find
   lots of information about it on the Web, but the basics are
   pretty simple.  Promise has two main methods that you use to set
   up completion handlers: then(), which invokes a function when
   the operation completes successfully, and catch(), which invokes
   a function if the operation fails.
</p>
<p>
   The actual handling of the completion event is up to you,
   and that part is just like in a browser.  The main difference
   with the Promise approach is that the syntax is simpler.
</p>

<p>
   Here's an example of a simple HTTP GET operation to fetch
   a page from a Web site.
</p>
<div class="code">
// create the request object
let request = new HttpRequest();

// Set up the HTTP verb and URL.  Important: always use true for the
// "async" parameter.  If you make the request synchronous, the main
// user interface window will freeze while Javascript waits for the
// request to finish.  Note that this only *prepares* the request;
// this doesn't trigger any network activity yet.
request.open("GET", "http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/", true);

// Initiate the network request, and set up handlers for
// completion and failure.
request.send().then(function(reply) {
    // This function handles successful completion.  "reply" is a
    // string containing the text of the page from the Web server.
}).catch(function(error) {
    // This function handles errors.  "error" is an Error object
    // describing the HTTP or network error.
});
</div>

<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   <b>abort():</b>  Call this method to cancel an asynchronous
   request in progress.
</p>
<p>
   <b>getAllResponseHeaders():</b>  Returns a string containing
   the full set of HTTP headers in the response, separated by
   CR/LF ("\r\n") line ending sequences.
</p>
<p>
   <b>getResponseHeader(<i>name</i>):</b>  Returns a string with
   the value of the header matching the given name.
</p>

<p>
   <b>open(<i>method, url, asynchronous, user, password</i>):</b>
   Sets up the verb (e.g., "GET", "POST") and URL ("http://...")
   for the request.  Optionally sets the username and password (also
   as strings).  The username and password will be used if necessary
   for HTTP authentication.  (HTTP authentication is rarely used these
   days; it's <i>not</i> the kind where you fill in text boxes on the
   site's login page, but rather the kind where the browser itself
   prompts you for credentials.)
</p>
<p>
   Important: always set <i>asynchronous</i> to <b>true</b>.  If
   you don't, the user interface windows will freeze while Javascript
   waits for the network request to complete.  You don't want that.
</p>
<p>
   The open() call just prepares the request; it doesn't actually
   initiate the network operation.  The network operation doesn't
   start until you call send().  
</p>
<p>
   <b>setRequestHeader(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>):</b>  Adds an
   HTTP header to the request, to be sent to the site with the
   request data.  You can use this to set cookies, for example.
</p>
<p>
   <b>send(<i>body</i>):</b>  Send the request.  <i>body</i> is
   an optional string containing the "body" data to send with the
   request, which is needed for verbs like "POST" and "PUT" that
   include request bodies.  ("GET" doesn't use a request body,
   so you shouldn't use a <i>body</i> argument with "GET".)
</p>
<p>
   Returns a standard Javascript Promise object that keeps track of
   the completion state of the request.  Use the returned Promise
   object to set completion handlers.  Use .then() to set a handler
   that will be invoked when the request completes successfully,
   and .catch() to set an error handler.  
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>readyState:</b>  A read-only property indicating how much
   progress the request has made so far: 0 (uninitialized), 1 (loading),
   2 (response headers received), 3 (partial body received), 4 (completed).
   In most cases, you won't need to monitor this, since you probably won't
   need to do anything with a request until it signals completion by
   calling the "then" handler via the Promise returned from send().
   However, some applications use the ready state to update incremental
   status indicators in the UI; you could do that, for example, by
   checking this property periodically in a timer callback.
</p>

<p>
   <b>responseText:</b>  A read-only property with a string containing
   the full text of the response from the server.  Valid only after
   the request has completed.
</p>

<p>
   <b>responseXML:</b>  An XML document object (as an
   <a href="OLEAutomation.html">OLE Automation object</a>) containing
   the parsed XML version of the response.  You can use this to interpret
   response formatted as XML.
</p>

<p>
   <b>status:</b>  A read-only property giving the numeric HTTP status
   code returned from the server.  Only valid after the request has
   completed.  200 is the standard status code for normal, successful completion.
   Codes 400 and above indicate errors (e.g., 404 = not found, 500 = internal
   server error, etc).  The full set of HTTP status codes can be found
   in numerous tutorials and references online.
</p>

<p>
   <b>statusText:</b>  A read-only property with a string giving
   the full text of the server status response (e.g., "200 OK").  Only
   valid after the request has completed.
</p>
