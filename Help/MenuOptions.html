<h1>Menu Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Exit menu options:</b>  The Exit menu normally pops up when
   you press the Cancel/Escape key when no other menus or popups are showing.
   It presents options for exiting PinballY and for a few other system
   options that don't belong in the main "game" menu.  These options
   let you control whether this menu is enabled and which commands
   it includes.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Enable Exit menu:</b>  Check this box to enable the
   menu.  If you un-check this box, the Cancel/Escape button will 
   be ignored when there aren't any menus or popups displayed.
   You can disable the Exit menu if you're running your pin cab
   in a public setting where you don't want users to be able to
   exit out of PinballY or access any other setup options.
   <p>
      If the Exit menu is disabled, you can still access its
      commands via the Operator menu, which you can display
      via the "service buttons" inside the coin door.  The
      Operator menu is accessed from the service buttons
      specifically because those buttons are behind the
      (normally locked) coin door, specifically to limit
      access in a public setting.
   </p>

   <li><b>Include Operator Menu option in Exit menu:</b>  Check
   this box if you want the Exit menu to include a command to
   show the Operator Menu, which provides access to commands
   related to game setup and PinballY options.  You can access
   the Operator Menu directly using the service buttons inside
   the coin door, if you have those; if you don't, this
   this option lets you access the Operator Menu from the
   basic menu buttons.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>"Cancel/Escape" button behavior in Exit menu:</b>  This controls what
   the Cancel/Escape button does while the Exit menu is being displayed.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Select the current command</b> means that the Cancel/Escape button
      acts like the Select button within the Exit menu.
      
   <li><b>Close the Exit menu</b> means that the Cancel/Escape button acts
      like it does in any other menu, canceling the menu.
</ul>

<p>
   This option might seem bizarre at first glance - why would you
   want to make the Cancel button do the opposite of what it normally
   does?  The rationale is that you activate the Exit menu in the
   first place by pressing the Cancel button, so in a way it's already
   acting like a "select" button in this context.  Some people find it
   more natural for it to keep acting like a "select" button throughout
   the Exit menu.  This option lets you set it up to match whichever
   sense seems more natural to you.
