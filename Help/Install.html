<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
   PinballY tries to make installation mostly automatic, but there
   are a few details that you might have to take care of manually,
   involving interactions with other, third-party programs.
   The PinballY Setup program is intentionally
   designed <i>not</i> to make any changes to any other programs on
   your system, since that's the source of so many problems in other
   installers, but the trade-off is that you might have to perform a
   few manual steps after installing.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY requires Windows 7 or later.  It won't work on Vista or XP.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft DirectX</h2>
<p>
   If you're running Windows 7, it might be necessary to upgrade to the
   latest Microsoft DirectX components.  If so, PinballY will display
   an error box complaining about missing DirectX components when you
   try to run it.  If you see such an error message, you probably really
   do need to update DirectX, <i>even if you already have DirectX 11
   installed</i>.  Microsoft released several updates to DirectX 11
   after Windows 7 was released, so the "11" you have might
   be one of the older ones.  Update instructions can be found on the
   Microsoft website:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx</a>
</div>
   
<p>
   That shouldn't be necessary if you have Windows 8 or later,
   since all necessary DirectX components
   are built into the operating system.
</p>


<h2>PinVol</h2>
<p>
   If you're using <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinVol.html">PinVol</a>,
   you should update to <b>version 1.2</b> (July 2018) or later.  PinVol added recognition
   for PinballY in that version to make the two programs work better together.

<h2>DOF (DirectOutput Framework)</h2>

<p>
   If you're using DOF for feedback devices in your pin cab, a few extra
   steps might be required.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For the 64-bit version of PinballY, you'll need
   one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html">DOF R3++</a>
   releases dated <b>2018-09-04</b> or later.  Earlier versions of DOF
   don't work with 64-bit programs.
   
   <li>Go to your Direct Output install folder, and open the Config folder.
   Make a copy of the file <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b> and
   name it <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
   
   <li>If you haven't refreshed your DOF config files from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a>
   lately, you should update them now.  Log in to the site in your
   browser, and generate and download a fresh set of .ini files.
   That will ensure that your DOF settings include the new effects for PinballY.
   
</ul>

<h2>Real DMD</h2>
<p>
   If you're using a real DMD (dot matrix display) device, such as a PinDMD or Pin2DMD,
   you might need to update your copy of DmdDevice.dll (the system component that
   accesses the DMD device).
</p>
<p>
   DmdDevice.dll is normally installed as part of your Visual Pinball setup.  If
   you used the VP installer, it should have placed a copy of DmdDevice.dll in
   VP's VPinMAME subfolder.  That might be an older version, though.  For best
   results, make sure you're using one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An official dmd-extensions release, version <b>1.7.2 or later</b>,
   available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
   
   <li>One of my patched versions (1.7.1, 1.7.2), available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
</ul>

<p>
   Version 1.7.2 (even my patched 1.7.2) has a known bug that prevents it from
   working with ROM colorizations, so some people are still using my 1.7.1
   patch for the time being, until that bug is fixed in the official
   release branch.
</p>

<p>
   If you're not sure which version you have installed, open the file properties
   (from the Windows desktop) for the file <b>DmdDevice.dll</b>, normally
   found in your Visual Pinball\VPinMAME folder.  Check the Product
   Version under the Details tab as shown at right.
</p>

<h2>Real DMD + 64-bit PinballY</h2>
<p>
   The 64-bit version of PinballY requires the 64-bit version of DmdDevice.dll.
  It's safe to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit
  versions of the DLL at the same time.  The trick is to make sure the 64-bit version is
  named <b>DmdDevice64.dll</b>, so that it can coexist with the regular 32-bit
  <b>DmdDevice.dll</b> without creating a file naming conflict.   
</p>
   

<h2>Adobe Flash Player</h2>
<p>
   <b>No longer used!</b>  As of version 1.1 Beta 5, PinballY can render
   SWF files directly, without Flash Player or any other external software.
   In the past, PinballY required an Adobe Flash Player
   plug-in to display Instruction Card files that were prepared in the SWF format.
   Adobe made Flash Player obsolete at the beginning of 2021 and pushed an update
   that disabled existing installations.  PinballY addressed this (as of 1.1 Beta 5)
   by adding its own built-in mini-renderer that can display simple SWF files
   without any plug-ins. If you were keeping Flash Player installed just
   for PinballY's sake, you can delete it.
