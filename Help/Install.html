<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
   PinballY tries to make installation mostly automatic,
   but there are a few details that you might have to take
   care of manually.
</p>

<h2>Flash Player</h2>

<p>
   If you want PinballY to be able to display .swf (Shockwave Flash) files
   for pinball instruction cards, you'll have to install the Adobe Flash
   Player ActiveX control, also known as the Flash plug-in for IE (Internet
   Explorer).  PinballY specifically requires the <b>ActiveX</b> version,
   so you might have to add that to your system even if you already have
   the Flash plug-in for Firefox or Chrome, as those browsers use
   their own separate plug-ins that PinballY can't use.
</p>
<p>
   Why in the world are we talking about SWF files 
   when even Adobe considers them obsolete?  Because most of the
   HyperPin Media Packs available online use SWF files for their
   instruction card images.  This is mostly for historical reasons:
   HyperPin (the earliest virtual pinball front end) used SWF
   files for instruction cards, so it's what everyone used in the
   early days to create Media Packs, and it's stuck ever since.
   Those Media Pack files are still the most convenient source of 
   instruction cards, flyers, and other media.  Maybe someday,
   someone will tackle the rather large task of converting them
   all to a more modern image file format.  Until then, it's easiest to
   install Flash so that you can use all of those existing SWF files.
</p>

<h2>PinVol</h2>
<p>
   If you're using <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinVol.html">PinVol</a>,
   you should update to <b>version 1.2</b> (July 2018) or later.  PinVol added recognition
   for PinballY in that version to make the two programs work better together.
</p>

<h2>DOF (DirectOutput Framework)</h2>

<p>
   If you're using DOF for feedback devices in your pin cab:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If you're using the 64-bit version of PinballY, make
   sure your DOF software is one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html">DOF R3++</a>
   releases dated <b>2018-09-04</b> or later.  Earlier versions of DOF
   don't work with 64-bit programs.
   
   <li>Go to your Direct Output install folder, and open the Config folder.
   Make a copy of the file <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b> and
   name it <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
   
   <li>If you haven't refreshed your DOF config files from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a>
   lately, you should update them now.  Log in to the site in your
   browser, and generate and download a fresh set of .ini files.
   That will ensure that your DOF settings include the new effects for PinballY.
   
</ul>

<h2>Real DMD</h2>
<p>
   If you're using a real DMD (dot matrix display) device, such as a PinDMD or Pin2DMD,
   you might need to update your copy of DmdDevice.dll (the system component that
   accesses the DMD device).
</p>
<p>
   DmdDevice.dll is normally installed as part of your Visual Pinball setup.  If
   you used the VP installer, it should have placed a copy of DmdDevice.dll in
   VP's VPinMAME subfolder.  That might be an older version, though.  For best
   results, make sure you're using one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An official dmd-extensions release, version <b>1.7.2 or later</b>,
   available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
   
   <li>One of my patched versions (1.7.1, 1.7.2), available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
</ul>

<p>
   Version 1.7.2 (even my patched 1.7.2) has a known bug that prevents it from
   working with ROM colorizations, so some people are still using my 1.7.1
   patch for the time being, until that bug is fixed in the official
   release branch.
</p>

<p>
   If you're not sure which version you have installed, open the file properties
   (from the Windows desktop) for the file <b>DmdDevice.dll</b>, normally
   found in your Visual Pinball\VPinMAME folder.  Check the Product
   Version under the Details tab as shown at right.
</p>

<h2>Real DMD + 64-bit PinballY</h2>
<p>
   The 64-bit version of PinballY <b>requires</b> the 64-bit version of DmdDevice.dll.
  It's safe to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit
  versions of the DLL at the same time.  The trick is to make sure the 64-bit version is
  named <b>DmdDevice64.dll</b>, so that it can coexist with the regular 32-bit
  <b>DmdDevice.dll</b> without creating a file naming conflict.
