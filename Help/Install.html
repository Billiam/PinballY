<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
   PinballY tries to make installation completely automatic,
   but there are a few details that you might have to take
   care of to make PinballY work with all of your other
   virtual pinball software.
</p>

<h2>PinVol</h2>
<p>
   If you're using <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinVol.html">PinVol</a>,
   you should update to <b>version 1.2</b> (July 2018) or later.  PinVol added recognition
   for PinballY in that version.
</p>

<h2>DOF (DirectOutput Framework)</h2>

<p>
   If you're using DOF for feedback devices in your pin cab, a few
   extra steps might be needed:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If you're using the 64-bit version of PinballY, make
   sure your DOF software is one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html">DOF R3++</a>
   releases dated <b>2018-09-04</b> or later.
   
   <li>Go to your Direct Output install folder, and open the Config folder.
   Make a copy of the file <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b> and
   name it <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
   
   <li>If you haven't refreshed your DOF config files from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a>
   lately, you should update them.  Log in to the site in your
   browser, and generate and download a fresh set of .ini files.
   That will ensure your DOF settings include the new effects for PinballY.
   
</ul>

<h2>Real DMD</h2>
<p>
   If you're using a real DMD (dot matrix display) device (such as PinDMD or Pin2DMD),
   you might need to update your copy of DmdDevice.dll (the system component that
   accesses the DMD device).
</p>
<p>
   DmdDevice.dll is normally installed as part of your Visual Pinball setup.  If
   you used the VP installer, it should have placed a copy of DmdDevice.dll in
   VP's VPinMAME subfolder.  That might be an older version, though.  For best
   results, make sure you're using one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An official dmd-extensions release, version <b>1.7.2 or later</b>,
   available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
   
   <li>One of my patched versions (1.7.1, 1.7.2), available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
</ul>

<p>
   Version 1.7.2 has a known bug that prevents it from working
   with ROM colorizations, so some people are still using my 1.7.1
   patch for the time being, until that bug is fixed in the official
   release branch.  (My patched 1.7.2 doesn't have a fix for the
   colorization bug, so if you want to use colorization, stick with
   1.7.1 for now.)
</p>

<p>
   If you're not sure which version you have installed, open the file properties
   (from the Windows desktop) for the file <b>DmdDevice.dll</b>, normally
   found in your Visual Pinball\VPinMAME folder.  Check the Product
   Version under the Details tab as shown at right.
</p>

<h2>Real DMD + 64-bit PinballY</h2>
<p>
   The 64-bit version of PinballY <b>requires</b> the 64-bit version of DmdDevice.dll.
  It's safe to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit
  versions of the DLL at the same time.  The trick is to make sure the 64-bit version is
  named <b>DmdDevice64.dll</b>, so that it can coexist with the regular 32-bit
  <b>DmdDevice.dll</b> without creating a file naming conflict.
