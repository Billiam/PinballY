<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>
   PinballY tries to make installation mostly automatic, but there
   are a few details that you might have to take care of manually,
   involving interactions with other, third-party programs.
   The PinballY Setup program is intentionally
   designed <i>not</i> to make any changes to any other programs on
   your system, since that's the source of so many problems in other
   installers, but the trade-off is that you might have to perform a
   few manual steps after installing.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY requires Windows 7 or later.  It won't work on Vista or XP.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft DirectX</h2>
<p>
   If you're running Windows 7, it might be necessary to upgrade to the
   latest Microsoft DirectX components.  This will be necessary if
   PinballY shows an error box complaining about missing DirectX
   components when you try to run it.  Update instructions can be
   found on the Microsoft website:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx</a>
</div>
   
<p>
   If you have Windows 8 or later, all necessary DirectX components
   are built into the operating system.
</p>


<h2>Flash Player</h2>

<p>
   <img src="SampleInstructionCard.png" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 1em 2em;">
   If you want to be able to use .swf files for scanned pinball
   instruction card images, the <b>Adobe Flash Player ActiveX</b> control
   (also known as the Flash plug-in for Internet Explorer) must
   be installed on your system.  PinballY doesn't need Flash for anything
   else, so you only have to install Flash if you want to be able to display
   .swf instruction card images.  If you already have the Flash Player
   ActiveX installed, no additional setup should be needed for this.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="SWF.html">Flash Player</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2>PinVol</h2>
<p>
   If you're using <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinVol.html">PinVol</a>,
   you should update to <b>version 1.2</b> (July 2018) or later.  PinVol added recognition
   for PinballY in that version to make the two programs work better together.

<h2>DOF (DirectOutput Framework)</h2>

<p>
   If you're using DOF for feedback devices in your pin cab, a few extra
   steps might be required.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For the 64-bit version of PinballY, you'll need
   one of my <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/dll-updates.html">DOF R3++</a>
   releases dated <b>2018-09-04</b> or later.  Earlier versions of DOF
   don't work with 64-bit programs.
   
   <li>Go to your Direct Output install folder, and open the Config folder.
   Make a copy of the file <b>GlobalConfig_B2SServer.xml</b> and
   name it <b>GlobalConfig_PinballY.xml</b>.
   
   <li>If you haven't refreshed your DOF config files from
   <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a>
   lately, you should update them now.  Log in to the site in your
   browser, and generate and download a fresh set of .ini files.
   That will ensure that your DOF settings include the new effects for PinballY.
   
</ul>

<h2>Real DMD</h2>
<p>
   If you're using a real DMD (dot matrix display) device, such as a PinDMD or Pin2DMD,
   you might need to update your copy of DmdDevice.dll (the system component that
   accesses the DMD device).
</p>
<p>
   DmdDevice.dll is normally installed as part of your Visual Pinball setup.  If
   you used the VP installer, it should have placed a copy of DmdDevice.dll in
   VP's VPinMAME subfolder.  That might be an older version, though.  For best
   results, make sure you're using one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>An official dmd-extensions release, version <b>1.7.2 or later</b>,
   available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/freezy/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
   
   <li>One of my patched versions (1.7.1, 1.7.2), available at
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases">github.com/mjrgh/dmd-extensions/releases</a>
</ul>

<p>
   Version 1.7.2 (even my patched 1.7.2) has a known bug that prevents it from
   working with ROM colorizations, so some people are still using my 1.7.1
   patch for the time being, until that bug is fixed in the official
   release branch.
</p>

<p>
   If you're not sure which version you have installed, open the file properties
   (from the Windows desktop) for the file <b>DmdDevice.dll</b>, normally
   found in your Visual Pinball\VPinMAME folder.  Check the Product
   Version under the Details tab as shown at right.
</p>

<h2>Real DMD + 64-bit PinballY</h2>
<p>
   The 64-bit version of PinballY requires the 64-bit version of DmdDevice.dll.
  It's safe to install both the 32-bit and 64-bit
  versions of the DLL at the same time.  The trick is to make sure the 64-bit version is
  named <b>DmdDevice64.dll</b>, so that it can coexist with the regular 32-bit
  <b>DmdDevice.dll</b> without creating a file naming conflict.
