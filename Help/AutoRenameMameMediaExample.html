<h1>Auto Rename MAME Media Files</h1>

<p>
   I've heard from a couple of people who had very large collections
   of MAME games set up in PinballX, and wanted to try running
   them with PinballY, but found that PinballY wasn't finding
   the media files for the MAME games because they were named
   according to the MAME ROM file names.  PinballX looks for
   media files under several naming conventions, including the
   ROM file names, so a lot of people set up their PinballX
   collections using the ROM naming convention.
</p>
<p>
   When I wrote PinballY, I intentionally chose to use a single naming
   convention for media files, rather than looking under multiple
   naming conventions the way that PinballX does.  I prefer to keep
   this sort of thing to be as simple as possible - so one naming rule,
   not many - because it's easier to learn, easier to explain,
   and less to go wrong in the software.  PinballY simply uses the
   "Title (Manufacturer Year)" naming pattern for all media files;
   users don't have to guess what PinballY is looking for,
   since you can count on that single naming rule always
   applying.  But there is one downside
   in this case, which is that some people migrating from PinballX
   might have chosen to use one of PinballX's other naming
   conventions, so PinballY won't find those media files until
   they're renamed to follow the uniform PinballY convention.
</p>
<p>
   If you have a media file collection already set up using
   one of PinballX's other naming rules, such as the ROM names,
   it might not be that big a deal to rename the files manually
   if you have a small collection of games.  But if you have a
   large or very large collection, as some people do, it might
   be completely out of the question to rename the files by hand.
</p>
<p>
   Fortunately, the renaming that's necessary is pretty mechanical
   in most cases, so it's something that we can automate.  To help
   out people in this situation, I wrote a little Javascript script
   that does the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Each time you visit a game in the wheel UI, the script
   looks to see if the game has any media files under the
   "standard" PinballY media naming convention.

   <li>If not, the script looks to see if there are any media
   files under the "alternative" name that PinballX looks for
   based on the ROM name

   <li>If there are media files under the "alternative" name,
   and no media files under the "standard" name, the script
   renames all of the alternative-named files to use the standard
   name instead
</ul>

<p>
   Since the script operates by renaming media files as you visit
   games, you just have to go through each game in the UI once
   to rename everything.  Then you can disable or remove the
   script (which you really should do when you're done with it,
   since the script slows down the UI a little bit by doing all
   of those extra file searches each time you visit a game).
</p>

<p>
   This script is so specialized that I'm not going to try to explain
   its workings in detail; I don't think most of what it does will
   be very applicable to other situations.  So I'll just present
   the script without further explanation.  However, I did at least
   include a lot of comments within the script, so you should be able
   to get a good idea of how it works by reading through it.

// Automatic media file renamer
//
// Copy this into a file called Main.js in your PinballY\Scripts folder.
// Exit out of PinballY if it's running, and restart it.  As you scroll
// through your games, this script will check each game as it's selected
// in the wheel to see if the game has any media files under the expected
// media file name, using the "Title (Manufacturer Year)" naming rule.
// If no such files are found, it'll look to see if the game has any media
// files under the alternative PinballX convention, which lets you name
// media files the same as the raw table file name (in the case of MAME
// video games, this is typically the name of the MAME ROM file).  If
// so, the script will automatically rename the files to match the
// "Title (Manufacturer Year)" convention.
//
// Note that this might slow down scrolling through the wheel UI a bit,
// so you'll probably want to install this script only long enough to go
// through all of your games once (one at a time).  The file renaming is
// permanent, so you should only need to make one pass through an existing
// collection.  You can then remove the script for normal use.

            // of the game's existing media files under the *old* name,
            // to give us a chance to rename them.  If this list has any
            // entries, we'll know that there are existing files.  We
            // don't *really* want to change the game's media name - this
            // is purely to probe for the existence of the files.  However,
            // it also has a handy side effect, which is that if we change
            // the name to the "alt" name, and then change it *back*, the
            // change back will give us the same information about extant
            // media files under the "alt" name.  So, step 1: change the
            // media name to the "alt" name, WITHOUT actually renaming any
            // existing files, purely to probe for existing files.

                // files under the "alternate" name?  If so, we'll want to
                // rename those files to the "standard" name.  Luckily,
                // thanks to the media name change we just made, the next
                // step is practically trivial.  Since the game's media name
                // is now the "alt" name, renaming it BACK to the "standard"
                // name will have the effect of searching for extant media
                // files under the "alt" name and renaming them to the
                // "standard" name.  In this case, we'll let the update()
                // function do the renaming for us.  Note that we don't even
                // have to make any extra checks for extant files here; the
                // mere act of updating the media name from "alt" to "std"
                // will have the desired side effect of renaming any media
                // files that exist under the "alt" name, and won't do
                // anything if not.  And it also puts things back in their
                // original state for the game's metadata, so two birds, one
                // stone!
                game.update({mediaName: stdMediaName}, {renameMedia: true});

<h2>Anther approach</h2>

<p>
   There's an alternative to renaming all of your files, if that seems
   cumbersome or undesirable to you.  (You might prefer not to do that,
   for example, if you plan to switch back and forth between PinballX
   and PinballY, or if you're only trying out PinballY temporarily.)
</p>
<p>
   Instead of renaming the files, we can override the media name that
   PinballY looks for, on a per-game basis.  A script that does that is
   <i>almost</i> the same as the script above, since the key to accomplishing
   it is to change the <b>mediaName</b> property of each game.  When
   <b>mediaName</b> has a custom value, PinballY will use that custom
   value to look for media files, instead of using the default
   "Title (Manufacturer Year)" pattern.
</p>
<p>
   To get the script above to do this, we'd just have make a couple
   of changes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In the last step, where we use <b>{renameMedia: true}</b> to
   carry out the file renaming step, we'd instead use <b>{renameMedia: false}</b>
   to change the name back <i>without</i> renaming any files.

   <li>We'd <i>also</i> capture the return value from that last <b>update()</b>
   call, just like we did earlier with the first <b>update()</b> result.

   <li>We'd then check the return value from the last <b>update()</b> to see
   if any existing files would have been affected by the media name change,
   by checking <b>(update.renamedMediaFiles || []).length &gt; 0)</b>.

   <li>If files were affected, we'd do yet another <b>update()</b> just like
   the first one, to put the alternative ROM media name into effect,
   leaving files unchanged.  This final update will leave the alternative
   ROM media name in effect permanently for the game.  PinballY will now
   look for your existing media files whose names are based on the ROM
   name each time this game is selected.
</ul>

<p>
   This approach has the advantage that it doesn't mess with your files.
   Renaming your files en masse might have some unwanted side effects;
   for example, if you use a backup program, this might force your
   backup program to make new (and redundant) backup copies of all of
   those media files, since it might not recognize that they're actually
   existing files with new names.
</p>
<p>   
   The only reason I didn't write the script to use this approach in the
   first place is that it overrides the PinballY defaults, which
   means your system will have an unusual setup from that point on.
   I always think it's preferable to use the
   default rules as much as possible, because my own experience - not
   with PinballY specifically, just with all software in general - is
   that you're always asking for trouble when you go outside the
   defaults.  The defaults are what most people use, so they're what
   gets tested the most and what gets fixed first when something goes wrong.
   The more "custom" you make your system, the more likely you are to
   encounter an obscure bug that's there just because no one thought
   to test that particular case before.  So I think the most reliable
   approach here is to go with the flow by renaming the files to fit
   PinballY's default expectations, rather than changing PinballY's
   defaults to fit your existing files.  But as I said
   above, you might have good reasons not to want to rename hundreds
   or thousands of files, and those reasons might be good enough
   to justify going outside the defaults here.
