<h1>DOF Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you control how PinballY uses DOF (the DirectOutput
   Framework).  DOF is a separate software package that manages feedback
   devices in a pin cab, such as flipper solenoids and flasher lights.
   PinballY can use DOF to activate your feedback devices when events occur
   in the UI.  For example, it can trigger the flipper solenoids when you
   press the flipper buttons, and flash your flasher lights when switching
   between games.
</p>
<p>
   The only option in the DOF setup page is <b>Enable DOF effects</b>.
   Check this box to use DOF effects in PinballY; un-check it to disable
   these effects.  This only affects PinballY's DOF usage, obviously; it
   won't change the way DOF is used in Visual Pinball or any other
   programs.
</p>

<h2>DOF setup</h2>
<p>
   To use DOF with PinballY, the only thing you have to do is install
   DOF itself.  PinballY automatically detects and accesses DOF once
   it's installed.  There's no need to install or configure anything
   extra to use DOF with PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   The specific DOF effects that PinballY triggers are defined through
   DOF's own configuration files.  Most people set up the DOF configuration using
   the online <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a>.
   As far as DOF is concerned, PinballY is just another pinball table,
   called "PinballY".  You can customize the PinballY DOF effects as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com/">DOF Config Tool</a> in your browser
   <li>Click on the Table Configs button in the top nav bar
   <li>Select <b>PinballY</b> in the Table Name drop list
</ul>
<p>
   All of the PinballY event triggers are "virtual" events, which have
   names starting with <b>$PBY</b>.  For a list of these events, see
   <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a>.
</p>
<p>
   For more information about DOF in general, see
   <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=DOF">DOF Setup</a>
   in the Pinscape Build Guide.
