<h1>Custom Launch Videos</h1>
<p>
   This example is closely related to the
   <a href="SeamlessLoadingExample.html">Seamless Loading Example</a>.
   It uses the same techniques to achieve a slightly different effect.
   In this case, we'd like to display a custom video while a game loads,
   with the ability to set up a separate video for each individual game.
</p>

<p>
   The core of this is the same as for the Seamless Launch: we listen for the
   <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html"><b>launchoverlayshow</b> event</a>, which
   fires when the system is about to display the extra graphics layers where
   the launch progress messages ("Loading... Running...") appear during a game
   launch.  When we see this event fire, we'll load our own video into the
   background portion of the launch overlay.  This is just a matter of
   calling the <a href="DrawingLayer.html#loadVideo">loadVideo</a> method on
   the <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a> object that represents
   the launch overlay background:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    let video = "MyLaunchVideo.mp4";
    mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.loadVideo(video);
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>

<p>
   This simply loads a video called <b>MyLaunchVideo.mp4</b> from the
   working folder (the PinballY install folder).  The call to
   <b>ev.preventDefault()</b> is there to keep the system from
   displaying its own background graphics:  normally, if the event
   handler doesn't say otherwise (by calling preventDefault), the system
   will try to load a default background video (<b>Game Launch Background.mp4</b>)
   from the main PinballY Media folder, and failing that, it'll just display
   a neutral gray backdrop.  If we let that happen, it would replace our
   video before it even starts, which we obviously don't want.
</p>

<p>
   That gets us about halfway there, but it leaves out the part where we
   choose a specific video for each game being launched.  To do that, we have
   to come up with a way to associate a custom launch video file with each game,
   and a way to search the disk for that file based on the game being launched.
</p>
<p>
   Now, PinballY gives us a built-in function to search for
   certain types of video files that are associated with individual games, such
   as the main playfield video, the backglass video, and the DMD video.  If you
   wanted to get the disk file name of the current game's playfield video, that's
   something we can easily do: we just get the <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object representing the current game, and call that object's
   <a href="GameInfo.html#resolveMedia">resolveMedia()</a> method, specifying
   the media type name for playfield videos.  The same would go for the
   other standard video types, such as the backglass video or DMD video.
</p>
<p>
   But there's no built-in category like this for a per-game
   launch video.  Does this mean we have to replicate PinballY's media
   search function on our own.  Fortunately, we don't.  Instead, PinballY
   lets us create our own new, custom <a href="MediaTypes.html">media type</a>
   for this new special category we've invented for "launch videos".
   Custom media types act essentially like the pre-defined types once you
   create them, with the same per-game file-searching capabilities as the
   pre-defined types.
</p>
<p>
   Here's how we could define a new media type for Launch Videos:
</p>

<div class="code">
gameList.createMediaType({
    id: "tableLaunchVideo",
    configId: "tableLaunchVideo",
    name: "Table Launch Video",
    folder: "Table Launch Videos",
    perSystem: true,
    format: "Video",
    extensions: ".f4v .mp4 .mov .mpg .mkv .wmv .m4v .avi",
    hasDropButton: true,
});
</div>

<p>
   Now that we've defined the media type, we can go back and fix up our
   event handler to use it to find the current game's launch video:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    // get the current game
    let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0);

    // resolve the launch video for this game
    let videos = gameList.getWheelGame(0).resolveMedia("tableLaunchVideo", true);

    // if we found a video, display it in the launch overlay background window
    if (videos.length > 0) {
        // load the video
        mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.loadVideo(videos[0]);

        // skip the default background setup
        ev.preventDefault();
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   As we mentioned in the seamless launch example, it's a good idea to remove
   the video as soon as the game finishes loading, so that we don't slow down
   the system by continuing to play back the video in the background while
   the game runs.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gamestarted", ev => {
    mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.clear(0xff404040);
});
</div>

<h2>Installing the videos</h2>
<p>
   There's still the small matter of actually installing the launch videos!
</p>
<p>
   Just place suitable video files in a new folder called <b>Table Launch Videos</b>
   in each "system" folder in your main Media folder - e.g., PinballY\Media\Visual Pinball\Table Launch Videos.
   You'll have to create the <b>Table Launch Videos</b> subfolders yourself,
   since they're not a standard part of the media tree.  For the individual
   video files, use the same naming convention as for the table videos and
   so forth: each file should use the canonical "Game Title (Manufacturer Year)"
   format, as described in <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>
   (see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#PerGameFileNaming"><b>Media files for each game</b></a>).
</p>
<p>
   Note that you can change the folder name <b>Table Launch Videos</b>, if you want.
   Recall that it's not anything special to PinballY - it's just something we made
   up when we created our custom media type via <b>GameList.createMediaType()</b>.
   If you want to use a different folder name, just change the folder name defined
   in the method call.
</p>
