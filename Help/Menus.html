<h1>Menus</h1>

<p>
   PinballY's on-screen menu system is the workhorse of its UI, handling most
   user interactions.  The menu system is functionally similar to conventional
   Windows mouse menus, but it's designed to be convenient to operate with just
   the basic pin cab buttons, and it's visually styled to look more like arcade
   graphics and with larger type for readability at a distance.
</p>
<p>
   You can use the menu system from your Javascript code to create your own
   custom menus and display them whenever needed.  You display a custom menu
   by calling   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>.<a href="MainWindowObject.html#showMenu">showMenu()</a>.
   This function lets you create a menu that looks and operates
   exactly like the built-in menus, and lets you populate it with standard
   system commands and/or your own custom commands.
</p>
<p>
   The showMenu() function is called as follows:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.showMenu(<i>id</i>, <i>items</i>, <i>options</i>);
</div>


<p>
   <i>id</i> is a string giving an internal identifier for the menu.  This can be
   any string you want; the system merely stores it, and reports it back to
   you via the .menuID property of the status object returned from
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getUIMode">mainWindow.getUIMode()</a> while the
   menu is still being displayed.
</p>
<p>
   <i>items</i> is an array of menu item descriptors.  Each descriptor is an
   object with the following properties.  The boolean flag properties are all
   optional; if omitted, they default to false.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>title: a string giving the title of the item, or an empty string to display
   a separator bar instead of a named item
   <li>cmd: an integer giving the command number (see <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>),
   or -1 if this item can't be selected as a command item
   <li>selected: true if the item is pre-selected when the menu opens, as though the user
   had navigated to this item already.  Only one item can be selected at a time, so if
   multiple items have this flag, the last one with the flag is the one that's actually
   selected.
   <li>checked: true if the item should be displayed with a checkmark
   <li>radio: true if the item should be displayed with a radio button bullet (this is
   mutually exclusive with "checked", as only one type of mark can be displayed)
   <li>hasSubmenu: true if the item should be displayed with an arrow indicating that
   it has a sub-menu
   <li>stayOpen: true if the menu should stay open when the item is selected.  This can
   be used for items that update a setting in place and leave the menu open for further
   selections.
</ul>
<p>
   The <i>options</i> object can be omitted, in which case the default settings are
   used.  If present, <i>options</i> can have the following properties, all of which
   are optional and default to false or zero as appropriate:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>isExitMenu: true if this should be treated as an "Exit" menu.  The special
   feature of an Exit menu is that the Exit button acts like the Select button within
   the menu, if that behavior is configured in the user's option settings.  The rationale
   for this behavior is that some people find it more intuitive to make selections in a
   menu with the same button that opened the menu, so a menu that's opened with the Exit
   button should also use the Exit button to make selections.

   <li>noAnimation: true if you want to skip the normal menu opening animation and
   just display the menu instantly.  This is useful when you're updating a menu in
   place in response to a command, such as toggling a checkmark in a "stay open" item.

   <li>dialogStyle: true to display a "dialog style" menu.  This style is designed to
   accommodate a long-ish message at the top of the menu, followed by the usual
   complement of menu options below.  Dialog menus are displayed at a slightly wider
   size than regular menus, and the first item in the menu is displayed with a
   slightly smaller font than regular menu items, to pack more text into the available
   space.  The first item is also word-wrapped onto multiple lines if necessary
   (normal menu items are forced onto one line and clipped if they're
   too wide).  The first item in a dialog menu is
   by convention a static (non-selectable) message only, so it should have "cmd"
   set to -1 in its item descriptor.  It also usually looks best to use a separator
   bar as the second item, to visually reinforce the dialog styling.  The remaining
   items are ordinary menu items.
</ul>

<h2>Custom commands</h2>

<p>
   When you create your own menu, you'll probably want to include some custom
   commands:  that is, commands that aren't already provided by PinballY commands.
   To facilitate this, the system reserves the range of command IDs from
   <a href="Commands.html#UserFirst">command.UserFirst</a> to
   <a href="Commands.html#UserLast">command.UserLast</a> specifically
   for your use in Javascript code.  You can assign commands in this range
   as you see fit.
</p>
<p>
   Implementing a custom menu command generally requires two Javascript elements:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, you have to make the command accessible to the user, by
   adding it to some menu.  One way to do this is to
   add it to one of the existing system menus, which you can do by setting
   up a handler for the <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menushow</b></a> event that
   intercepts the system menu of interest and customizes it with your
   additional command(s).  Another way is to create your own entirely
   custom menu, and display it in response to an appropriate event, such
   as when the user presses a special key that you select as the custom
   menu key.  You could also use a <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b></a>
   event handler to display a custom menu whenever the user selects one of
   the standard system commands.

   <li>Second, create a <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b></a> event
   handler that processes the command.  The event handler should check the
   command ID in the event object, and when it matches the ID you selected
   (from the command.UserFirst...command.UserLast range), carry out the
   custom action for the command.
</ul>
   

<h2>Flow of control</h2>

<p>
   When you call mainWindow.showMenu(), the system displays the menu, and the
   function immediately returns.  It doesn't wait for the user to make a selection.
   Instead, the program continues running with the menu displayed.  The program
   will interpret user input in the context of menu navigation, so the user will
   be able to navigate among the menu items.  There's no need for your Javascript
   code to concern itself with any of the menu navigation, as that's handled
   automatically by the system.  When the user selects an item from the menu,
   it will trigger a <a href="CommandEvent.html">CommandEvent</a>, with the
   command ID that you specified in the selected menu item stored in the event
   object.  So the way you handle a command selected from your custom menu is
   to write a CommandEvent handler that responds to the custom command.
</p>

<div class="code">
// Display a custom menu when the user presses the Insert key
mainWindow.on("keydown", ev =&gt; {
    if (ev.code == "Insert") {
        mainWindow.showMenu("custom1", [
            { title: "Custom Command", cmd: command.UserFirst },
            { cmd: -1 },
            { title: "Return", cmd: command.MenuReturn }
        ]);
    }    
});

// Handle our "Custom Command" command
mainWindow.on("command", ev =&gt; {
    if (ev.id == command.UserFirst) {
       /* carry out the command here */;
    }
}); 
</div>

<h2>Paged menus</h2>

<p>
   In some cases, a menu might have too many items to fit into the available
   display space all at once.  This is especially possible when a menu gets
   its items from a dynamic source, where you don't know in advance exactly
   how many items will be included, such as the list manufacturer filters.
</p>
<p>
   To deal with menus that are known to be too large or that merely <i>could</i>
   be too large, depending on dynamic source data, the menu system can divide
   a menu into "pages" - groups of items that are displayed one page at a
   time.  The user can switch between the pages using the "Next Page" and
   "Previous Page" buttons (typically assigned to the Magna save buttons on
   a pin cab) or by selecting up/down arrow items shown graphically in the
   menu.
</p>
<p>
   Most paged menus have a <i>section</i> that's divided into pages, with
   some fixed items above and/or below the paged section.  This lets you
   keep the options common to all pages (e.g., "Cancel", "Save") on the
   screen at all times.
</p>
<p>
   To designate a section of a menu as paged, simply include an item
   with command ID <a href="Commands.html#MenuPageUp">command.MenuPageUp</a>
   before the first paged item, and another item with command ID
   <a href="Commands.html#MenuPageDown">command.MenuPageDown</a> after
   the last paged item.  The Page Up and Page Down items don't need
   titles; they'll be displayed with up/down arrow graphics instead.
   The menu system will automatically measure the height of the menu
   and determine if the paged area actually has to be split up into
   multiple pages.  If so, the menu will initially display the first
   page and will include the up/down arrows.  If the full menu fits
   the available screen height without any page divisions, the up/down
   arrow items are simply omitted.  So there's no need to figure out
   in advance whether or not the menu is "too big"; if there's any
   chance of that, you can simply include the page section markers
   and let the menu system figure out whether or not paging is
   necessary.
</p>

<h2>Menu events</h2>

<p>
   When a menu opens or closes, the system fires a <b>menuopen</b>
   or <b>menuclose</b> event (respectively).  See <a href="MenuEvent.html">MenuEvent</a>
   for details.
</p>


<h2>Customizing system menus</h2>

<p>
   You can suppress, edit, or replace any system menu by taking advantage of
   the <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menuopen</b></a> event.  This event lets
   you intervene every time the system is about to display one of its own
   standard menus.  You can use that opportunity to block a system menu
   entirely, make slight modifications (such as renaming items or adding
   your own custom items), or replace the system menu with your own
   entirely custom menu.  See <a href="MenuEvent.html#overrideSysMenu">Overriding a system menu</a>
   for details on how to accomplish these tricks.
