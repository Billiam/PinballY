<h1>Attract Mode Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you set up PinballY's "attract mode", which is a
   sort of screen-saver mode that kicks in when you haven't pressed
   any buttons for a while.  Attract mode acts as a screen saver by
   automatically changing the images displayed in each window
   periodically, which also helps make the machine more eye-catching
   when idling (thus the name "attract mode").
</p>
<p>
   <b>Enable attract mode:</b>  Check or uncheck this box to
   enable or disable attract mode.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Enter attract mode after idle (seconds):</b>  Sets the idle time
   before attract mode engages.  The idle time is simply the time
   since the last button press or other input event.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Switch games every (seconds):</b>  Sets the time between
   automatic game switches once attract mode is engaged.  The
   system will automatically switch games at this interval as
   long as it's in attract mode.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Attract mode status line messages:</b>  A list of messages to
   display on the status line while attract mode is active.  These
   messages replace the normal Upper/Lower status line displays.
   Enter one message per line.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Status line message time (seconds):</b>  Switching time
   for the status line messages.  Each message is displayed
   for this long, then the next message from the list is
   displayed.
