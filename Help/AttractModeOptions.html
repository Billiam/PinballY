<h1>Attract Mode Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you set up PinballY's "attract mode", which is a
   sort of screen-saver mode that kicks in when you haven't pressed
   any buttons for a while.  Attract mode acts as a screen saver by
   automatically changing the images displayed in each window
   periodically, which also helps make the machine more eye-catching
   when idling (thus the name "attract mode").
</p>
<p>
   <b>Enable attract mode:</b>  Check or uncheck this box to
   enable or disable attract mode.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Enter attract mode after idle (seconds):</b>  Sets the idle time
   before attract mode engages.  The idle time is simply the time
   since the last button press or other input event.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Switch games every (seconds):</b>  Sets the time between
   automatic game switches once attract mode is engaged.  The
   system will automatically switch games at this interval as
   long as it's in attract mode.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Attract mode status line messages:</b>  A list of messages to
   display on the status line while attract mode is active.  These
   messages replace the normal Upper/Lower status line displays.
   Enter one message per line.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Status line message time (seconds):</b>  Switching time
   for the status line messages.  Each message is displayed
   for this long, then the next message from the list is
   displayed.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Mute videos while in attract mode:</b>  Check this box
   to suppress audio tracks from background media while in
   attract mode.  
</p>

<p>
   <b>Hide wheel images while in attract mode:</b>  If this box
   is checked, the game title icons normally displayed across the
   bottom of the screen will be hidden while in attract mode.
</p>
<p>
   The reason you might want to hide the icons is to help avoid
   "burn-in" on your monitor in the icon area.
   Part of the purpose of attract mode is to act as a screen
   saver, which it does by frequently switching games so that
   the same background graphics aren't left on the screen for
   long periods.  Simply switching around the wheel icons
   isn't always good enough to avoid burn-in, though, because
   some people use sets of wheel icons with very similar
   overall background shapes and colors.  So even if the icons
   are switching around, the same background shape will always
   sit in the same area, which is exactly the kind of static
   graphics that can cause burn-in.  Hiding the icons helps
   avoid this.
