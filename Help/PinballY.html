<h1>Welcome to PinballY!</h1>

<p>
   PinballY is a "front end" menu system/game selector for virtual
   pinball cabinets.  A front end is a program that displays an
   arcade-style interface for scrolling through your virtual tables and
   selecting the one you'd like to play next.  It makes your cab
   friendlier and gives it more of an arcade feel by hiding the Windows
   desktop, and allowing you to access all functions through the basic
   set of pin cab buttons.

   PinballY is a free, open-source program
