   PinballY is a "front end" menu system/game selector for virtual
   pinball cabinets, providing an arcade-style interface for scrolling
   through your virtual tables and selecting the one you'd like to play
   next.  The idea is to make your pin cab feel more like an arcade
   machine and less like a Windows PC, by hiding the Windows desktop
   and letting you access most functions through the small set of
   buttons found on most pinball machines.
