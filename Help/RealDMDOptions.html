<h1>Real DMD Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you control how PinballY uses your real DMD
   device, if you have one.  By "real DMD", we mean an external
   pinball-style 128x32 dot matrix display, using either a plasma
   display like those used in the 1990s pinball machines, or an
   LED DMD like those used in some modern Stern machines.  You
   can add one of these to your cab by buying a commercial DMD
   kit like PinDMD, or by building one yourself using open-source
   plans such as Pin2DMD.
</p>
<p>
   The "real DMD" settings don't affect the simulated DMD window
   that PinballY also shows on the video monitor.  If you have a
   real DMD and want to get rid of the redundant video DMD window,
   simply close the window.  If you've previously closed the window
   and want to bring it back, right-click in the main playfield
   window and select "Show DMD" from the menu.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY supports the same sets of devices that Visual Pinball
   supports via VPinMAME, since it uses the VPinMAME DLLs to access
   the device.  See <a href="#detect">below</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2>Enable/disable options</h2>
<ul>
   <li><b>Automatic:</b>  This is the default, which makes PinballY look
   for a DMD device using the procedure described below and decide
   what to do based on the result.  If no device is found, PinballY
   silently ignores the DMD; there will be no error messages, since
   it's perfectly all right not to have a DMD installed.  If
   a device is found, PinballY will use it to display DMD media
   for games as you visit them in the game list.
<p>
   If automatic detection doesn't work on your machine for some
   reason, you can use one of the manual options below.
</p>

   <li><b>Enable always:</b>  This tells PinballY that you definitely
   have a DMD installed.  If this is selected, PinballY looks for
   the device using the procedure described below, and displays
   an error message if it fails.  This option is useful if you have
   a DMD, but PinballY doesn't seem to be using it.  When this
   setting is in effect, and PinballY can't find your DMD, it will
   at least display an error message with some more details on
   the problem, which might be helpful in clearing up what's wrong.

   <li><b>Disable always:</b>  This tells PinballY to ignore your DMD
   even if it looks like you have one installed.  This is useful
   if you have the DLL installed (see below) but you don't have
   a physical DMD device currently attached, since in that case
   the "Automatic" mode might trigger PinballY to show an error
   every time it starts up.  This settings will prevent PinballY
   from even trying to access the DMD, avoiding unnecessary
   error messages.

</ul>

<h2>Display effects options</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>Mirror horizontally:</b>  this reverses the dots across
   the display horizontally, as though you were looking at it in
   a mirror.

   <li><b>Flip vertically:</b>  this mirrors the dots vertically.
   This is useful if you have something like a Pinball 2000 style
   cabinet where the DMD is meant to be viewed indirectly by its
   reflection off the playfield glass.

</ul>

<a name="detect"></a>
<h2>How PinballY detects a DMD</h2>
<p>
   <b>Using VPinMAME:</b>  PinballY normally detects a real DMD automatically
   by finding it through your VPinMAME installation.  PinballY looks for
   a file called <b>dmddevice.dll</b> in your VPinMAME program folder. 
   That's the file that VPinMAME uses to access the DMD, so PinballY assumes
   that if you have a DMD, you would have installed the correct version of
   that DLL to make the DMD work with your Visual Pinball tables.  As long
   as Visual Pinball is working properly with your DMD, PinballY should
   automatically detect and use your DMD as well; no further setup should
   be needed.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Without VPinMAME:</b>
   If for some reason you don't have VPinMAME installed on your machine,
   you can still use a real DMD with PinballY by installing the correct
   version of dmddevice.dll in your PinballY program folder.  You'll still
   have to download VPinMAME so that you can get the correct version of
   the DLL, but you don't have to install any other parts of VPinMAME.
   Note that there are several different versions of the DLL in the
   VPinMAME download files, because the DLL version has to be tailored
   to the particular type of DMD device you have.  Be
   You might also need an additional DLL that came with your device.
   If your device came with its own DLL, copy that into the PinballY
   program folder as well.
