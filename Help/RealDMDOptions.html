<h1>Real DMD Options</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you control how PinballY uses your real DMD
   device, if you have one.  By "real DMD", we mean an external
   pinball-style 128x32 dot matrix display, using either a plasma
   display like those used in the 1990s pinball machines, or an
   LED DMD like those used in some modern Stern machines.  You
   can add one of these to your cab by buying a commercial DMD
   kit like PinDMD, or by building one yourself using open-source
   plans such as Pin2DMD.
</p>
<p>
   The "real DMD" settings don't affect the simulated DMD window
   that PinballY also shows on the video monitor.  If you have a
   real DMD and want to get rid of the redundant video DMD window,
   simply close the window.  If you've previously closed the window
   and want to bring it back, right-click in the main playfield
   window and select "Show DMD" from the menu.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY supports the same sets of devices that Visual Pinball
   supports via VPinMAME, since it uses the VPinMAME DLLs to access
   the device.  See <a href="#detect">below</a> for more details.
</p>

<h2>Enable/disable options</h2>
<ul>
   <li><b>Automatic:</b>  This is the default, which makes PinballY look
   for a DMD device using the procedure described below and decide
   what to do based on the result.  If no device is found, PinballY
   silently ignores the DMD; there will be no error messages, since
   it's perfectly all right not to have a DMD installed.  If
   a device is found, PinballY will use it to display DMD media
   for games as you visit them in the game list.
<p>
   If automatic detection doesn't work on your machine for some
   reason, you can use one of the manual options below.
</p>

   <li><b>Enable always:</b>  This tells PinballY that you definitely
   have a DMD installed.  If this is selected, PinballY looks for
   the device using the procedure described below, and displays
   an error message if it fails.  This option is useful if you have
   a DMD, but PinballY doesn't seem to be using it.  When this
   setting is in effect, and PinballY can't find your DMD, it will
   at least display an error message with some more details on
   the problem, which might be helpful in clearing up what's wrong.

   <li><b>Disable always:</b>  This tells PinballY to ignore your DMD
   even if it looks like you have one installed.  This is useful
   if you have the DLL installed (see below) but you don't have
   a physical DMD device currently attached, since in that case
   the "Automatic" mode might trigger PinballY to show an error
   every time it starts up.  This settings will prevent PinballY
   from even trying to access the DMD, avoiding unnecessary
   error messages.

</ul>

<h2>Display effects options</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>Mirror horizontally:</b>  this reverses the dots across
   the display horizontally, as though you were looking at it in
   a mirror.

   <li><b>Flip vertically:</b>  this mirrors the dots vertically.
   This is useful if you have something like a Pinball 2000 style
   cabinet where the DMD is meant to be viewed indirectly by its
   reflection off the playfield glass.

</ul>

<a name="detect"></a>
<h2>How PinballY detects a DMD</h2>
<p>
   PinballY doesn't actually detect your physical DMD device.  Instead,
   it looks for installed software that connects to your DMD.  If the right
   software is present, PinballY uses the software to send images to your DMD.
</p>
<p>
   The "right software" is a DLL called <b>dmddevice.dll</b>.  This usually
   comes from your VPinMAME installation, which in turn is usually installed
   as part of Visual Pinball.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY searches for dmddevice.dll as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, it looks in your PinballY install folder for the file.
   If it finds a copy there, it uses it.

   <li>Failing that, it looks in your VPinMAME folder.  This folder
   is found by looking in the Windows registry for the "VPinMAME
   COM object".  If that's found, PinballY looks for dmddevice.dll
   in the same folder containing the COM object.
</ul>

<p>
   If PinballY does find a copy of dmddevice.dll in either location,
   it proceeds as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the dmddevice.dll is the "DMD-Extensions" version, which is
   included in recent (2018) distributions of Visual Pinball 10,
   PinballY checks its config file (DmdDevice.ini) to see if
   it's set up for "virtual" mode, where it displays an on-screen
   DMD instead of using a real DMD.

   <ul>
      <li>If virtual mode is enabled, and PinballY's DMD setting
      is "Auto", PinballY skips the DMD for this session.  PinballY
      provides its own on-screen DMD window, so we figure you probably
      don't want two of those at the same time.
      
      <li>If virtual mode is enabled, and PinballY's DMD setting
      is "Enabled", PinballY uses the DLL even though it'll
      display its second on-screen DMD window.  "Enabled" means
      "show the DMD no matter what", so we're just doing what
      you asked.  If you don't like that second DMD window,
      either turn off "virtual" mode in the DmdDevice.ini file,
      or set PinballY's real DMD setting back to "Auto".
      
      <li>If virtual mode is disabled, PinballY goes ahead and
      uses the DLL.  When virtual mode is disabled, we assume
      that you have a real DMD.
   </ul>
   
   <li>For any other version of dmddevice.dll, PinballY just goes
   ahead and loads it unconditionally.
</ul>
            
<p>
   If PinballY can't find a copy of dmddevice.dll in either place,
   it assumes that you don't have a real DMD installed, so it simply
   omits any real DMD displays for the session.
</p>
<p>
   The search order above is intended to make DMD setup simple but flexible.
   Simple, in that if you've already set up your real DMD to work with
   VPinMAME, then PinballY should automatically find it and use it, without
   making you repeat the same setup work for PinballY.  Flexible, in that
   you can also force PinballY to use a different copy of dmddevice.dll
   from the one used in VPinMAME, if you prefer, sipmly by copying
   the alternative dmddevice.dll into the PinballY folder.
</p>
<p>
   If you do copy an alternative DLL to the PinballY folder, remember to also
   copy any additional DLL files that it depends upon.  There might be
   a second DLL for your specific hardware device that you have to include.
