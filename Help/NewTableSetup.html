<h1>New Table Setup</h1>

<p>
   PinballY tries to make it easy to set up new tables as you
   add them to your system, by letting you enter all of the
   descriptive information (title, manufacturer, etc) and adding
   media files from the main program.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the basic process for installing a new table in your
   PinballY menus.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Step one: download the table.</b>  The first step, obviously,
   is to get a new table and install it on your PC.  PinballY
   doesn't change anything
   about this part.  Just do this like you always did.  Go to your
   favorite download site, such as <a href="http://www.vpforums.org/">VP Forums</a>
   or <a href="http://vpuniverse.com/">VP Universe</a>, and grab the
   new table you're looking for.  Unpack it into the "Tables"
   folder for Visual Pinball or whichever system it uses.  Note
   that there's no need to exit PinballY while you do this; you
   can leave it running in the background.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Step two: find the new file in the PinballY wheel.</b>  
   By default, PinballY shows new table files in its game wheel, right
   right alongside your existing games.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you <b>don't</b> have to exit and restart PinballY during
   this part.  You can leave PinballY running in the background while
   you download a new game, and when you return to PinballY, the new
   game should be added to the wheel automatically.  PinballY checks
   for new files in all of your table folders each time you switch
   the program back to the foreground.
</p>
<p>
   A new table file that you just installed will be displayed using its
   Windows filename, since you haven't entered any of its details yet.
   PinballY doesn't know the game's true title until you enter it, so
   all it can show you at this point is the raw filename.  Tables in
   the wheel are sorted alphabetically, so you should find the new
   table wherever its filename sorts into the table list.
</p>
<p>
   If you don't see the new file immediately, make sure that you're
   viewing the "All Tables" filter rather than some more selective
   filter.  And if you checked the box for "Hide unconfigured games"
   in the options dialog, that will obviously prevent the new table
   from showing up in the normal list.  In this case, you'll have
   to specifically select the "Show Unconfigured Games" filter from
   the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Step three: enter the game's details.</b>  Once you've found
   the new file in the game wheel, press Start/Enter to bring up the
   main menu.  There'll be a new command near the top, "Game Setup".
   The main menu adds this command whenever an unconfigured game
   is selected.  (This command isn't in the main menu for games that
   have already been configured, but it's always available in the
   Operator Menu, so you can always go back and further edit a game's
   details any time after setting it up.)
</p>
<p>
   "Game Setup" will bring up another menu with commands
   for editing the game.  On this menu, select "Edit game details".
   This will bring up a dialog box that lets you enter the
   game's title and other bibliographic details.
</p>
<p>
   This is one of the points in PinballY where you'll need to
   reach for the regular mouse and keyboard.  Much as I like the
   media-rich, button-only UI style for game playing functions,
   it's just not the right interface when you have to enter a
   bunch of text.  On-screen keyboards with two-button navigation
   are just way too tedious.  So PinballY resorts to an ordinary
   dialog box here.  Note that if you've rotated your playfield,
   the dialog box won't rotate with it; it'll appear in the
   normal Windows desktop orientation for the monitor.  If
   you're running on a pin cab, you might prefer to drag it
   onto another monitor that isn't rotated, such as your
   backglass monitor.
</p>
<p>
   Now we get to one of my favorite parts.  You can see that
   the Title field has a little drop-list arrow at the right.
   Click it.  This will bring up a list of likely matches
   from a giant master list (derived from <a href="http://www.ipdb.org">IPDB</a>)
   of just about all of the real pinball machines ever made.  The dialog
   tries to use the filename to guess the game title,
   using "fuzzy matching".  The closest match is listed first,
   followed by several other possible matches. 
   If you see the right title in the drop list, just pick it.
   This will automatically fill in the rest of the dialog
   with the appropriate values for the selected game, taken
   from the IPDB data.
</p>
<p>
   The fuzzy matching isn't perfect, and filenames can be
   cryptic, so the initial list of guesses might not include
   the title you're looking for.  If it doesn't,
   you can search for the title by typing it directly into
   the title box.  As you type, the drop list will show
   new matches based on what you're typing.  The right title
   will usually appear after you've entered the first few
   letters.  As before, once the right match appears, just
   select it from the list to populate the rest of the
   form with the IPDB information for the game.
</p>
<p>
   Alternatively, if you already know the IPDB number for
   the game, you can skip the title search and just enter
   the IPDB number into the box labeled "IPDB ID".  Then
   click the button next to the box to fill in the rest of
   the form from the IPDB information for that game ID.
</p>
<p>
   And if all else fails, you can enter all of the details
   manually.  You can also manually override anything that you
   don't agree with from the IPDB data.  Just type new values
   into fields you want to change.
</p>
<p>
   The one other detail you might have to set manually is
   the System.  If you have multiple versions of Visual Pinball
   installed (which most people do), you'll have to select
   the one to use with this game.  PinballY can't always figure
   out which VP version to use for a given game, because VP
   re-used the same file extension across multiple program
   versions that can't actually use each other's files.
</p>
<p>
   Once you're satisfied with the game's details, click OK
   to save changes.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Editing a Game's Details</a>
   for more information on this dialog.
<p>
   <b>Step four: download media.</b>  Bring up the Game Setup
   menu again.  This time, select "Find game media online",
   then select "Search".  This will bring up your Web
   browser and navigate to a Google search for a "HyperPin
   Media Pack" for this game.
</p>
<p>
   At this point, you'll have to rely on your Web savvy to
   find the right HP Media Pack file.  Fortunately, this
   is usually really easy because the Web search usually
   works like magic.  The top result is almost always the right
   file from <a href="http://www.vpforums.org">VP Forums</a>.
   If the Web search doesn't turn up a good result, though,
   I'd recommend as a fallback that you manually browse
   for the file in the "Frontend Media and Backglass" section
   on <a href="http://www.vpforums.org">VP Forums</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Once you find the file on VP Forums or elsewhere, click
   through the links to download the file.  You should end
   up with a downloaded ZIP file (or perhaps another archive
   format like RAR or 7z).
</p>
<p>
   Now simply <b>drag and drop the downloaded ZIP file
      onto the PinballY playfield window</b>.  Assuming that the
   downloaded file is a valid HP Media Pack file, PinballY will
   show you a list of the media files it contains, giving you
   a chance to select the individual items to include or skip.
   Make your selections and select "Add Media" from the menu.
</p>
<p>
   The new media will appear on-screen immediately.  Again,
   there's no need to reboot PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   By the way, if you find any individual media items for
   a game that you want to add separately, that's easy, too.
   For example, suppose you find a video of the backglass
   that you want to install.  Just download the video and
   drop the file onto the backglass window.  If you find
   a DMD video, download it and drop it onto the DMD window.
   PinballY will install the file in the appropriate location
   for the window where you drop it.  You can do this with
   still graphics or videos for any of the windows.  You
   can also drop an audio file (.wav or .mp3) onto the
   playfield to install a "Launch Audio" file, which is
   played automatically each time you launch the game.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Step five: capture videos (optional).</b>  The HP
   Media Packs usually have static graphics for the playfield
   and backglass, but they almost never include any video.
   PinballY can display animated video graphics in all windows,
   which makes for a livelier browsing experience.
</p>
<p>
   Videos for some games are available online, but coverage
   is spotty, and they're not as easy to find as the Media Packs.
   Fortunately, PinballY makes it easy to create your own
   videos for all windows by capturing screen shots of
   the live game actually running.

   for how to use the built-in capture system.
