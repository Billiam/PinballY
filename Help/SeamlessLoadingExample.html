<h1>"Seamless" Game Launch</h1>
<p>
   An enhancement request on the github issue tracker proposed
   adding an option for
   "seamless launching".  The idea is to get rid of the blank
   black background that PinballY normally shows on the playfield
   screen while waiting for the game program to start up, and instead
   continue showing the playfield video as normal.  The status messages
   about the progress of the launch would still appear ("Loading...
   Running..."), but superimposed on the background video instead
   of on a boring black background.
</p>
<p>
   The new Javascript features in 1.0 Beta 17 make this pretty easy
   to implement.  They also make it easy to add custom touches, such
   as dimming the background video a bit, or superimposing some
   animated graphics to make the transition more dynamic looking.
</p>

<h2>Launch Overlay events</h2>
<p>
   The first system feature we can bring to bear on this problem is
   the <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html">Launch Overlay event</a>
   group, which gives us a natural place to put the code that will
   orchestrate the seamless loading UI.
</p>
<p>
   The black background that the system displays during the launch
   process is actually an overlay layer that's drawn in front of the
   normal background.  Another layer on top of this holds the status
   text with the "Loading... Running..." messages.
</p>
<p>
   When the system is about to display these overlay layers at the
   start of a launch, it fires a <b>launchoverlayshow</b> event.
   This is where we can intervene to prevent the normal black
   background from coming up, which we can do simply by blocking
   the default event processing, via the event object's
   preventDefault() method.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>


<h2>Tidying up the UI</h2>

<p>
   There are two other little details in the UI that we should
   take care of: hide the wheel, and hide the underlay.  These
   are both simple operations that we can add to our event handler:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    mainWindow.showWheel(false);
    mainWindow.setOverlay();
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>

<p>
   Having made those changes, we'll need to undo them when the
   game exits.  We actually don't have to worry about undoing
   the underlay removal, since that will come back on its own;
   the system pretends that you've selected a new game when
   it returns to the wheel UI after a game session has ended,
   which reloads all of its media, including any underlay.
   But we do have to restore the wheel to visibility explicitly.
   The system won't presume to override our wishes on the wheel
   hiding until we say otherwise.
</p>
<p>
   The place to take care of these end-of-launch cleanup tasks
   is in the <b>launchoverlayhide</b> event, which the system fires
   when it's removing the launch overlay at the end of a game
   launch session.  This event is the bookend to <b>launchoverlayshow</b>,
   so it's the place to undo changes we make there.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayhide", ev => {
    mainWindow.showWheel(true);
});
</div>


<h2>Launch overlay drawing layers</h2>
<p>
   Preventing the default system processing on a <b>launchoverlyshow</b>
   event is actually all we have to do to leave the playfield video
   showing throughout the launch.  That's the only point at which the
   system will try to cover up the background video.  But I also
   want to point out that we can do more than just blocking the
   system's default black background.  We can actually take it
   over and provide a different background of our own!
</p>
<p>
   The way we can draw our own background is to use the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay</a>
   objects.  That property gives us an object, which in turn contains
   two properties, <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b>, giving us two more
   objects.  <b>mainWindow.launchOverlay.fg</b> is the "foreground"
   layer of the launch overlay, which is where the system draws the
   "Running... Loading..." text message updates.  
   And <b>mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg</b> is the background layer,
   which the system normally fills with an opaque dark gray.
</p>
<p>
   Those two objects are <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a>
   objects, so they offer flexible graphics capabilities: you can
   use them to display still image files, videos, or your own
   custom graphics, using the <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom
   Drawing</a> facility.
</p>
<p>
   As a simple example, let's place a thin veil over the playfield
   video to emphasize that we're not in the normal PinballY
   interactive mode while we're waiting for the launch.  We'll
   still make the video visible, but we'll dim it out a little
   and give it a purple tint.  We can do this simply by filling
   the overlay background layer with a partially transparent
   fill color:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.clear(0x20FF00FF);
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>
<p>
   This fills the background layer with color code 0x20FF00FF.
   That parses as 20 (hex) for the alpha value, which is about
   12% opacity, meaning it's mostly but not entirely
   transparent.  The rest is RGB for bright purple, the
   same as HTML code #ff00ff, which looks like this:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <div style="display: inline-block; width: 2em; height: 2em; background: #ff00ff">
   </div>
</div>
<p>
   When that's combined at 12% with the background playfield video,
   it'll dim the background slightly and give it a tinge of the
   foreground color.
</p>
<p>
   Note that we don't have to worry about undoing our custom background
   the game launch ends, since the system will automatically remove
   the launch overlay on its own.  The same goes for any other custom
   drawing we do, or for loading an image or video into the overlay
   layer.
</p>

<h2>Moving the progress messages to the DMD</h2>

<p>
   Another little tweak you might want to make to the launch UI
   is to move the status messages out of the playfield window
   and into the DMD window instead.  The DMD screen is, after all,
   the place where the newly launched game will display its own
   messages, so it's natural to move the launch messages there
   as well.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this is only possible with a <b>video</b> DMD screen.
   If you have a <b>real</b> DMD device - not a video screen, but
   a plasma or LED score display like on a real
   pinball machine - we unfortunately can't use it for launch
   status messages.  The reason is that the real DMD hardware
   devices can't be shared by two programs at once, which
   makes it critical for PinballY
   to disconnect itself from the DMD hardware before it
   launches the game.  If it doesn't do that, the game program
   might encounter an error trying to connect to the device,
   because of the one-program-at-a-time limitation.  So it's
   really important for PinballY to release the DMD before the
   launch process even begins, thus making it impossible to
   display any progress messages there during the launch.
</p>
<p>
   We can display the launch messages on the DMD by using a
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">custom drawing layer</a> in
   the DMD window.  And we can use the <a href="DrawingLayer.html#drawDMDText">drawDMDText()</a>
   method on the drawing layer to make the message look like
   an actual DMD message.
</p>
<p>
   The way to intercept the status update messages is via
   the <b>launchoverlaymessage</b> event.  That event fires
   each time the system updates the progress message.  Left
   to its own devices, the system will display the message
   as text in the foreground layer of the launch overlay.
   We can intercept the event, display the message in the
   DMD window instead, and then cancel the event (via
   preventDefault()) to keep the system from displaying
   its own message in the playfield window.
</p>
<div class="code">
// Create a drawing layer in the DMD window.  This is just
// a global variable, so the layer will always be around;
// it'll be invisible most of the time, since we'll clear
// it to all transparent pixels when it's not in use.
let dmdLaunchMessageLayer = dmdWindow.createDrawingLayer(1000);

// now intercept launch message updates to display the
// messages on the DMD overlay instead of the main window
mainWindow.on("launchoverlaymessage", ev => {
    dmdLaunchMessageLayer.drawDMDText(ev.message || "", {
        font: "12px";
    });
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>

<p>
   The reason that we wrote (<span class="code">ev.message || ""</span>)
   rather than just using the message directly is that the
   message can be null in some cases, and if you use a
   null value where a string is expected, Javascript converts
   the null to the literal string "null".  For our purposes
   here, we'd prefer to render these null messages as
   no text at all, which the "or" syntax accomplishes.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you can specify some other options in drawDMDText()
   to control the display style, but we're intentionally letting
   the system choose the defaults based on the current game, so
   that our display harmonizes the with the game's normal
   DMD-window appearance.  The one option we're customizing
   is the DMD font, which we've set to "12px".  If we let
   the system choose the DMD font, it'll pick the biggest
   font that will make the text fit, so successive messages
   might be drawn in different fonts.  That looks a little
   awkward, so I prefer to set a fixed font; the "12px"
   font is a good all-purpose size for the launch messages.
</p>
<p>
   There's one more little detail (isn't there always?).
   When the launch process is over, we'll want to get rid
   of the overlay, so that we return to normal media and
   high score displays in the DMD window.  <b>launchoverlayhide</b>
   is once again the place for these end-of-launch cleanup
   tasks.  We can effectively hide the layer by filling
   it with a fully transparent (zero alpha) background.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayhide", ev => {
    dmdLaunchMessageOverlay.clear(0x00000000);
});
</div>


<h2>Playing an animated overlay</h2>
<p>
   A neat thing you can do with the launch overlay is to
   display a video or animated GIF that plays during the launch process.
   There are lots of little animated GIF snippets on the Web with special effects loops
   that could make nice decorative effects during a launch.
   Here's how you could load such an animation into the launch overlay
   background layer, when the launch process first starts up:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("launchoverlayshow", ev => {
    let animation = gameList.resolveMedia("Images", "launch.gif");
    mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.loadImage(animation);
});
</div>

<p>
   Here we've assumed that you've found a suitable animated
   GIF file, named it <b>launch.gif</b>, and placed it in the
   PinballY Media\Images folder.  Remember that
   we're talking about customization here, so this GIF isn't a
   file that comes with PinballY - it's just something that
   we made up for the sake of this example, and we leave it
   as an exercise to find an animation clip you like for this.
</p>
<p>
   You could just as well use a video file, replacing the
   call to <b>loadImage()</b> with a call to <b>loadVideo()</b>.
   We went with the GIF for this example just because it seems
   easier to find little effect-loop clips in animated GIF format
   than in video formats.
</p>
<p>
   We'll want to hide the animated image as soon as the game has
   finished loading, both because it'll stop being appropriate
   visually at that point, and because we don't want the animation
   taking up system resources while the game is running.
   To hide the image, we can use the <b>gamestarted</b> event
   (see <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a>):
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("gamestarted", ev => {
    mainWindow.launchOverlay.bg.clear(0xff404040);
});
</div>

<p>
   That fills the launch overlay background layer with an opaque
   dark gray - basically the same thing the system would have done
   on its own at the start of the launch, if we hadn't intervened.
   Clearing the drawing layer removes any video or image
   that was displayed in the layer, so this will tidy up the
   UI and reduce our performance impact, just as we wanted.
</p>
<p>
   The original motivation of this chapter was to make the
   launch process seamless, by <i>not</i> covering up the
   playfield image or video, so this idea of loading an
   animation or video into the overlay might not quite fit the
   original plan.  Even so, I wanted to mention it, since some
   people might  prefer it as a third option that's even better
   than leaving the playfield video playing.  There's also a
   best-of-both-worlds option, which is that GIF animations
   can contain transparent areas.  A transparent
   GIF would superimpose an effect animation on top of the
   playfield background, so you'd have both the "seamless"
   part and the special effect.  There are even a few video
   formats that support partial transparency:  see
   <a href="AlphaVideo.html">Alpha transparency in videos</a>
   for more on that.
