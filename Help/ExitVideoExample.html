<h1>Play a video and DOF effects at program exit</h1>

<p>
   PinballY has a built-in option to play an introductory video when the
   program starts up, but it doesn't currently have a corresponding option for
   playing a video when you quit the program.  I could add something like
   that in the future, but when you start thinking about all of the
   possible variations (what about system shutdown? or rebooting?
   different videos for each window?), it seems better to leave it to
   Javascript, since that's so much more flexible than a "checkbox"
   option setting could ever be.  Fortunately, Javascript's
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Custom Drawing Layers</a> feature
   makes it really easy to play custom videos any time you want to.
   So playing a video before quitting is just one specific way we
   can use that general mechanism.
</p>
<p>
   Another custom task that you might want to do at program exit,
   which dovetails nicely with playing an exit video, is triggering a
   special DOF effect at program exit.  Once again, PinballY has a way
   to play DOF effects at program startup (the <b>PBYProgramStartup</b>
   DOF event), which you can learn more about in the section
   on <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a>.  But, oddly, there's
   no corresponding "Program Quit" event for DOF.  Well, not <i>so</i>
   oddly; there's actually a good reason for omitting it, which is
   that such an event wouldn't work as you'd want it to.  The problem
   is that DOF, by design, always resets all of the physical devices
   when the host program that's controlling it (PinballY, in this case)
   exits.  So even if PinballY did fire off a "Program Quit" event to
   DOF just before exiting, DOF would just ignore it, because DOF
   would be more concerned with its overriding mandate to return
   everything to neutral conditions as soon as the controlling
   program terminates.
</p>
<p>
   So how do we overcome this DOF limitation, and how does a DOF exit
   event dovetail (as we promised) with an exit video?  Well, the
   obstacle with the DOF "program exit" event is that DOF stops playing
   effects as soon as the program exits.  So the way to overcome this
   obstacle is to delay the program exit until the DOF light show is
   finished.  But it would be awfully clunky if the program just kind
   of stopped working while waiting for the DOF effect to finish; the
   user might wonder why the program isn't obeying the Quit command.
   The "dovetail" is that playing an exit video is an excellent way
   to fill the extra time, in a way that lets the user know that the
   Quit command was received and understood.
</p>
<p>
   There's one more DOF limitation that's relevant here that I should point
   out.  DOF doesn't have any mechanism to let the host program find out
   what's it's up to, in terms of the physical effects its playing.
   The communications between the host program (PinballY) and DOF
   are strictly one-way, from host to DOF: the host tells DOF about
   events, and DOF plays effects in response.  What I'm getting at is
   that PinballY and Javascript have absolutely no way to know how long
   the programmed DOF light show for the "exit program" event will take,
   so there's no way to know when the light show is over.  You'll just
   have to time your exit video so that it takes roughly the same amount
   of time as the light show you set up (or vice versa).  That's not very elegant, I know, and
   it's fragile - if you ever re-program the DOF light show, you'll have
   to edit your video to adjust its play time accordingly.  But it's
   a limitation we can't do anything about in PinballY, and it wouldn't
   be at all straightforward to add such a capability to DOF.  So it's
   something we have to live with.
</p>

<h2>Hooking into the Quit command</h2>
<p>
   We can trigger our special handling for the Quit command by setting
   up an event listener for the <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b> event</a>,
   and checking the command being executed to see if it's <b>command.Quit</b>
   (see <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> for a full list of the
   command codes).  If you've read through any of the other worked
   examples, you're already familiar with this pattern.
</p>
<p>
   The system fires a <b>command</b> event when the user presses a button
   associated with the command or selects the command from a menu, and
   <i>before</i> the system actually carries out the command's action.
   This gives Javascript a chance to preempt the normal command action,
   by canceling the event by calling <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>
   on the <a href="Event.html">Event object</a> passed to the event handler.
</p>
<p>
   With that in mind, here's the general outline for how we'll intercept
   the Quit command and replace the system's normal processing with our
   own.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.Quit) {
        // tell the system NOT to carry out its standard Quit processing
        ev.preventDefault();

        // *** do our custom Quit handling here ***
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   The system's default handling for the Quit command is to exit the
   program, so preventing the default handling will prevent the program
   from actually quitting.  That's exactly what we want in this case,
   since we want to keep the program running until the video finishes.
   But it also makes it impossible for the user to exit PinballY (short
   of resorting to external measures, like terminating the process via
   the Windows Task Manager).  So we'll want our custom handler
   to <i>eventually</i> carry out the Quit command for real - we don't
   want to prevent quitting entirely, we just want to slow down the
   process so that the program keeps running long enough to play the
   video and/or DOF effects.  When we're finally ready to quit for
   real, we can do that from Javascript, by invoking the Quit command
   from the script code:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit);
</div>
<p>
   Invoking a command from a script as shown above doesn't trigger another
   <b>command</b> event; it just directly invokes the system's internal
   handling for the command.
</p>
   


<h2>Playing the custom video</h2>
<p>
   Now that we have the basic framework for intercepting the Quit command,
   let's get the video going.  We do this using a <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a>.
   Briefly, a drawing layer is a canvas that you can create in any PinballY
   window to display graphics, including still images, videos, and complex
   graphics drawn from scripting code.
</p>
<p>
   We create a drawing layer via the <a href="WindowObjects.html#createDrawingLayer">createDrawingLayer()</a>
   method of the window where we want to create the layer.  For this example,
   we'll do everything in the main playfield window.  You can use the same
   technique to show videos at the same time in any or all of the other windows,
   if you like.
</p>
<div class="code">
let layer = mainWindow.createDrawingLayer(10000);
</div>
<p>
   The argument value that we pass, 10000, is the "Z index" of the new drawing
   layer, which specifies how it's layered relative to other graphics in the
   same window.  We've chosen 10000 because it places the video in front of
   all of PinballY's own native graphics in the window, meaning that it blocks
   out all of the other graphics.  It's like placing a piece of paper with the
   new drawing on the top of a stack of other pictures.  The user will only
   see the exit video.  See <a href="MainWindowObject.html#drawingLayers">Drawing layer ordering</a>
   in the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow object</a> chapter for
   details on the Z index values of the built-in graphics.
</p>
<p>
   To play a video in the layer, we use the <a href="DrawingLayer.html#loadVideo">loadVideo()</a>
   method of the drawing layer object.
</p>
<div class="code">
let video = gameList.resolveMedia("Videos", "Quit Video", "video");
layer.loadVideo(video, { loop: false });
</div>
<p>
   Note that we've used <a href="GameList.html#resolveMedia">gameList.resolveMedia()</a> to
   find the video file within our Media folder tree.  You <i>could</i> just hard-code a
   filename path directly, rather than going through the extra step of searching with
   resolveMedia(), but the search makes the script a little more robust by avoiding any
   hard-coded folder locations.  If you move your PinballY setup to a different drive
   letter or folder location at some point in the future, this approach will make the
   script automatically adapt, without any need for you to go back and fix up paths
   coded into the script code.
</p>

<h2>Quitting when the video ends</h2>
<p>
   Remember the warning earlier about how overriding the Quit command will prevent
   the program from exiting, and how it's up to the script to trigger the actual
   exit at some point?  Let's look at how we do that.
</p>
<p>
   Since the whole point of this exercise is to play a video as the program exits,
   the time when we want the real program termination to occur is when the video
   finishes playing.  One simple way to accomplish that would be to use
   the <a href="SystemFunctions.html#setTimeout">setTimeout()</a> function, which
   lets us schedule a task to occur after a certain delay time has elapsed.
   So if we know that our exit video is exactly 5 seconds long, we could use
   setTimeout() to schedule the program exit to occur after 5 seconds.
   setTimeout() works in terms of <b>milliseconds</b>, and there are 1000 of
   those per second, so our 5-second delay is equivalent to a 5000ms timeout:
</p>
<div class="code">
setTimeout(() => mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit), 5000);
</div>
<p>
   That's easy, but it's not the ideal way to accomplish our real goal of
   synchronizing with the end of the video.  It's not ideal because it hard-codes
   a dependency on the length of the video, which means that you'd have to change
   the code if you ever wanted to switch to a different video.  Fortunately,
   there's a way of finding out when the video finishes: the
   <a href="VideoEvent.html"><b>videoend</b> event</a>.  That event fires
   on a drawing layer when a video playing in the layer finished playing
   (or, if the video is playing on loop, each time one full cycle completes).
   Writing the event handler to catch the end of the video is almost exactly
   like writing the timeout handler:
</p>
<div class="code">
layer.on("videoend", ev => mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit));
</div>

<h2>Activating a DOF light show</h2>
<p>
   The standard setup for PinballY in the DOF Config Tool doesn't have anything
   programmed for when PinballY exits, since, as we mentioned earlier, PinballY
   doesn't have a native DOF event for "quit program".  The main reason there's
   no such native event is that it wouldn't work properly, because of the way
   DOF resets everything as soon as the host program exits.  But now that we're
   delaying PinballY's actual program exit by playing back a video, we could
   take advantage of this time to also play back some DOF effects while the
   video is playing.
</p>
<p>
   Triggering custom effects in DOF is just a matter of sending a custom event
   name to DOF via <a href="MainWindowObject.html#DOFSet">mainWindow.DOFSet()</a>:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.DOFSet("MyPBYProgramExit", 1);
</div>
<p>
   You can use whatever name you want for the event.  I'd avoid using names
   that start with <b>PBY</b>, to avoid creating the impression when you look
   at the script later on that the event is some kind of native PinballY
   event.  I'd use a prefix to suggest that it's something you made up,
   like "MyPBY" or "PBYCustom".  But that's up to you; as far as PinballY
   and DOF are concerned, it's just an arbitrary label, so you can use whatever
   name you like.
</p>
<p>
   Now, since you're making up a new event name here, DOF obviously isn't going
   to know what to do with it on its own.  You'll <i>also</i> have to go into
   the DOF Config Tool and set up your custom light show programming for the
   event.  Programming effects in the Config Tool is a big subject, beyond
   what we want to get into here, but here's the basic outline:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the <a target="_blank" href="http://configtool.vpuniverse.com">DOF Config Tool</a>
   <li>Log in
   <li>Select the <b>Table Configs</b> tab at the top
   <li>Select <b>PinballY</b> in the Table Name drop list
   <li>Find the devices you want to fire when your custom event occurs
   <li>Add triggers to those toys for <b>$MyPBYProgramExit</b> (or whatever you called the event),
   noting that you have to add the <b>$</b> prefix to the event name when using it in the Config Tool rules
   (but <b>not</b> in the Javascript code)
</ul>
<p>
   For more on programming custom DOF effects, see
   <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=dofEventCodes">DOF Event Codes</a> in the
   <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/">Pinscape Build Guide</a>.
</p>

<h2>Suppressing other commands and button presses</h2>
<p>
   One more little detail that we might want to handle is preventing the
   user from doing anything else while waiting for the program to exit.
   We don't want the user to change games or launch a game, or even bring
   up other menus.
</p>
<p>
   We can do this by intercepting two types of events:
   <a href="CommandEvent.html"><b>command</b></a> and
   <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html"><b>commandbuttondown</b></a>.  Between
   those two event types, we'll cover just about everything the user can
   do through the UI.  All we have to do with them is suppress the system
   handling, by using preventDefault() on the event object as usual.
</p>
<p>
   To be even more certain that we take over the handling of these events,
   we can call <a href="EventTarget.html#off">mainWindow.off()</a> to remove
   any <i>other</i> Javascript handlers for these events that are defined
   elsewhere in our scripts.  (That's pretty unfriendly to other scripts
   that you might want to mix into your system, so I wouldn't do this
   in most cases.  But it's perfectly okay for this Quit scenario, since
   the other scripts aren't going to run again at this point anyway
   now that we're locked onto a trajectory of exiting the whole session.)
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off("command commandbuttondown");
mainWindow.on("command commandbuttondown", ev => ev.preventDefault());
</div>
   
<h2>Complete script</h2>

<p>
   Putting all of that together, here's the complete script!
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == command.Quit) {
        // stop the system from actually quitting yet
        ev.preventDefault();

        // start our custom DOF light show for exiting
        mainWindow.DOFSet("MyPBYProgramExit", 1);

        // block other commands and command buttons while quitting
        mainWindow.off("command commandbuttondown");
        mainWindow.on("command commandbuttondown", ev => ev.preventDefault());

        // start the exit video
        let layer = mainWindow.createDrawingLayer(10000);
        layer.loadVideo(gameList.resolveMedia("Videos", "Quit Video", "video"), { loop: false });

        // when the exit video finishes, quit for real
        layer.on("videoend", ev => { mainWindow.doCommand(command.Quit); });
    }
});
</div>
