<h1>Folder Options</h1>
<p>
   PinballY uses a number of external files to read and store
   information on the pinball tables you have installed on your system,
   and the video and graphic files displayed in the UI.  This dialog
   lets you tell PinballY where to look for these files.
</p>

<h2>Media folder</h2>

<p>
   This is the base folder where all of the
   graphics and video files for your games are installed.  This
   folder contains subfolders for different media types and for
   different systems (Visual Pinball, Future Pinball, etc).  The
   actual media files are stored in subfolders according to the
   type of image/video they contain.
</p>
<p>
   This is the "global" base folder that contains all of the
   other media folders, so this folder affects all game systems.
   Each system's media folder is always a subfolder of this
   main folder.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Use the PinballY folder:</b>  Selects the <b>Media</b>
   folder within your main PinballY install folder (the folder where
   you installed the PinballY program files).

   <li><b>Use the PinballX folder:</b>  Selects the <b>Media</b>
   folder within your PinballX program folder, assuming you've
   also installed PinballX.  This option is useful if you've
   been using PinballX and you've already set it up with videos
   and images for your tables, because it lets PinballY share your
   existing PinballX media files directly, without the need to copy
   or move any files.   This option also makes it easy to switch
   back and forth between PinballX and PinballY.

   <p>
      You shouldn't use this option if you haven't installed
      PinballX, since there won't be an existing PinballX
      folder to share in this case.  This will cause errors
      when PinballY tries to read files from the non-existent
      folder location.
   </p>

   <li><b>Use a different folder:</b>  This option lets you
   choose a specific folder, rather than using one of the
   default locations.  This gives you full control in case
   you have an unusual setup that requires a special location
   for these files.
   <p>It's usually better to use one of the
   defaults, since the default settings will adapt more
   automatically if you ever move files around.  If you enter a
   fixed folder path, you'll have to remember to update the
   setting if you should ever move that folder to a different
   parent folder or to a different disk drive. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Table database folder</h2>

<p>
   This is the base folder where your "table database" files are
   stored.  These are XML files that contain information the installed
   games, such as the title of each game, the manufacturer, and the
   pinball program that it's written for.
</p>
<p>
   As with the Media folder, this is the global base folder for
   all of the individual table database folders for the different
   game player systems (Visual Pinball, etc).  Each system has its
   own subfolder within this main folder.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Use the PinballY folder:</b>  Selects the <b>Databases</b>
   folder within your main PinballY install folder (the folder where
   you installed the PinballY program files).

   <li><b>Use the PinballX folder:</b>  Selects the <b>Databases</b>
   folder within your PinballX program folder, assuming you've
   also installed PinballX.  This option is useful if you've
   been using PinballX and you've already set up your table
   lists there, because it lets PinballY share your existing PinballX
   table lists directly, without the need to copy
   or move any files.   This option also makes it easy to switch
   back and forth between PinballX and PinballY.

   <p>
      You shouldn't use this option if you haven't installed
      PinballX, since there won't be an existing PinballX
      folder to share in this case.  This will cause errors
      when PinballY tries to read files from the non-existent
      folder location.
   </p>

   <li><b>Use a different folder:</b>  This option lets you
   choose a specific folder, rather than using one of the
   default locations.  This gives you full control in case
   you have an unusual setup that requires a special location
   for these files.
   
   <p>It's usually better to use one of the
   defaults, since the default settings will adapt more
   automatically if you ever move files around.  If you enter a
   fixed folder path, you'll have to remember to update the
   setting if you should ever move that folder to a different
   parent folder or to a different disk drive. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Sort the XML database files by table title</h2>
<p>
   If you check this box, PinballY will rearrange the &lt;game&gt; tags
   in the XML database files into alphabetical order, by table title,
   whenever it saves changes to the XML files.
</p>
<p>
   By default (if this box is <b>not</b> checked), PinballY simply
   preserves the original ordering of the tags in the files, to minimize
   the changes it makes, in case you arranged the tags by hand into a
   particular order on purpose.
</p>
<p>
   If you hand-edit the files outside of PinballY, it might (or might
   not) be more convenient to have PinballY rearrange the tags into
   sorted order by table name.  You can use this option to select
   which way works better for your situation.
</p>
<p>
   If you don't have any need to hand-edit the XML files, you
   probably don't care what order they're in.  In that case, it's
   better to leave the box un-checked, since the sorting process
   takes a little extra time each time the files must be updated.
</p>
<p>
   Note that PinballY will only rearrange the files into sorted
   order when it needs to save changes.  PinballY tries to avoid
   re-writing the XML files unless it's actually necessary, which
   means that you've made some sort of change to table metadata
   that requires updating the files.  So checking this box by itself
   won't have any immediate effect on the XML files; they'll only be
   rearranged into sorted order the next time they need to be
   saved due to metadata changes, such as changes made through
   the Edit Game Details dialog.
