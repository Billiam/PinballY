<h1>Folder Options</h1>
<p>
   PinballY uses a number of external files to read and store
   information on the pinball tables you have installed on your system,
   and the video and graphic files displayed in the UI.  This dialog
   lets you tell PinballY where to look for these files.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>Media folder:</b>  this is the folder where all of the
      graphics and video files for your games are installed.  This
      folder contains subfolders for different media types and for
      different systems (Visual Pinball, Future Pinball, etc).  The
      actual media files are stored in subfolders according to the
      type of image/video they contain.

   <li><b>Table database folder:</b>  This is the folder where
      your "table database" files are stored.  These are XML files
      that contain information the installed games, such as the
      title of each game, the manufacturer, and the pinball program
      that it's written for.

</ul>

<p>
   In most cases, you should be able to use the default settings
   for the folder paths.  You can change them as needed if you have
   an unusual setup.  Here are the basic options for each folder
   type:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Auto:</b>  This is the default setting for each type.
   When this option is selected, PinballY will first look to see
   if you also have PinballX installed on your system.  If so,
   it'll use the existing PinballX folder for this item.  If not,
   PinballY will use the appropriate folder within the PinballY
   program folder.
   <p>
      This option is the default because it works whether or
      not you have PinballX installed, and if you <i>do</i> have
      PinballX installed, it lets you use all of your existing
      table lists and media without having to copy or move
      any files.  It makes it pretty much effortless to try
      out PinballY and migrate to it if you like it.  PinballY
      is compatible with the PinballX database and media formats
      and folder structures, so you can always go back to PinballX
      later if you like, even if you use PinballY to add new tables
      and/or media.  You can also freely switch back and forth
      between the two programs.
   </p>

   <li><b>Use the PinballY folder:</b>  This tells PinballY to
   ignore any existing PinballX installation on your machine and
   use only the PinballY program folder.
   <p>
      This option is useful if you want to maintain separate
      PinballX and PinballY installations, rather than sharing
      files between the two, since it prevents
      PinballY from trying to access your PinballX files.  This
      lets you have separate table lists and separate
      media files for each system.
   </p>

   <li><b>Use a different folder:</b>  This option lets you
   choose a specific folder, rather than using one of the
   default locations.  This gives you full control in case
   you have an unusual setup that requires a special location
   for these files.
   <p>It's usually better to use one of the
   defaults, since the default settings will adapt more
   automatically if you ever move files around.  If you enter a
   fixed folder path, you'll have to remember to update the
   setting if you should ever move that folder to a different
   parent folder or to a different disk drive. </p>

</ul>
