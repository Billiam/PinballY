<h1>Instruction Card Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Instruction card popup location:</b>  Selects the window where the
   instruction card popup will appear when you use the "Instructions"
   command in the main menu.  If the window you select is closed when
   you try to bring up an instruction card, the popup will appear
   in the main playfield window instead.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this doesn't affect the separate Instruction Card window,
   which is designed to be positioned on a dedicated instruction card
   monitor on your pin cab apron.  If you don't have a dedicated
   monitor for that, you can just close the Instruction Card window
   so that it doesn't take up any display space.  (To close it,
   right-click in the window and select Close from its menu.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>Include .swf (Shockwave Flash) files when searching for instruction card images:</b>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will include Shockwave Flash
   (.swf) files when searching for instruction card images, along
   with the normal set of image file types (.png, .jpg, .jpeg).
   If this box isn't checked, .swf files will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY can only display .swf files 
   if you have the Adobe Shockwave Flash Player ActiveX
   installed on your system.  If you don't have Flash installed,
   you'll get an error message every time PinballY tries to load
   an .swf file, to let you know that you need to install Flash
   Player to use those files.  The error message is intended to
   be helpful, to let you know what you need to do to view those
   files successfully, but it's just an annoyance if you deliberately
   avoid Flash.  This option is provided so that you
   can get rid of those error messages if you never plan to
   install Flash.  If you un-check this box, PinballY will silently
   ignore .swf files when looking for instruction card images.
   It'll still look for conventional image files (PNG and JPEG).
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="SWF.html">Flash Player</a> for more details,
   including instructions on how to install the correct version
   of the Flash plug-in.
