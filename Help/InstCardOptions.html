<h1>Instruction Card Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Instruction card popup location:</b>  Selects the window where the
   instruction card popup will appear when you use the "Instructions"
   command in the main menu.  If the window you select is closed when
   you try to bring up an instruction card, the popup will appear
   in the main playfield window instead.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this doesn't affect the separate Instruction Card window,
   which is designed to be positioned on a dedicated instruction card
   monitor on your pin cab apron.  If you don't have a dedicated
   monitor for that, you can just close the Instruction Card window
   so that it doesn't take up any display space.  (To close it,
   right-click in the window and select Close from its menu.)
