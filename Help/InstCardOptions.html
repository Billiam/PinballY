<h1>Instruction Card Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Instruction card popup location:</b>  Selects the window where the
   instruction card popup will appear when you use the "Instructions"
   command in the main menu.  If the window you select is closed when
   you try to bring up an instruction card, the popup will appear
   in the main playfield window instead.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this doesn't affect the separate Instruction Card window,
   which is designed to be positioned on a dedicated instruction card
   monitor on your pin cab apron.  If you don't have a dedicated
   monitor for that, you can just close the Instruction Card window
   so that it doesn't take up any display space.  (To close it,
   right-click in the window and select Close from its menu.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>Include .swf (Shockwave Flash) files when searching for instruction card images:</b>
   If this box is checked, PinballY will include Shockwave Flash
   (.swf) files when searching for instruction card images, along
   with the normal set of image file types (.png, .jpg, .jpeg).
   If this box isn't checked, .swf files will be ignored.
</p>
<p>
   This option is essentially obsolete, because it was primarily
   for the benefit of people who didn't want to install Adobe
   Flash Player on their systems.  Adobe Flash Player itself is
   now completely obsolete (as of the start of 2021), so this is
   no longer a factor - <i>no one</i> should have Flash Player
   installed any more.  As of PinballY version 1.1 Beta 5,
   PinballY displays SWF files with its own built-in mini-renderer,
   so there's no need for Flash Player any more.  If you
   disable SWF display in the past because you didn't want
   to install Flash Player, you can now re-enable SWF if you
   like, since doing so will no longer trigger any errors
   about a missing plug-in.
</p>
<p>
   (In case you're worried that the
   built-in SWF renderer might bring the security risks that
   made many people wary of installing Flash Player, I don't
   think it will: the problems with Flash Player mostly arose
   from its scripting capability, which is deliberately not
   implemented in the PinballY mini-renderer.  The PinballY SWF
   renderer is completely original, open-source code that you can
   inspect for yourself, and it's very stripped down to support
   only the minimal subset of SWF static graphics capabilities
   that the extant HyperPin Media Pack instruction cards
   rely on.  There should be little to no security risk in
   this small subset of features.)
