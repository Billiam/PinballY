<h1>HighScoresEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event class is fired when the system retrieves high score
   information for a game.  High score information is normally
   handled through the external program <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinemhi.com/">PinEMHi</a>.
   PinEMHi is included with the PinballY install, and PinballY invokes
   it automatically when needed, so this isn't something that the user is
   even normally aware of.  But this is how PinballY reads high score
   information for games that provide it using one of the "standard"
   formats supported by PinEMHi
</p>
<p>
   This event has the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>highscoresrequest:</b>  Fired when PinballY is about to launch
   PinEMHi to retrieve high scores for a game.  This event can be canceled,
   which prevents PinballY from invoking PinEMHi, and can return its own
   substitute high score information.

   <li><b>highscoresready:</b>  Fired when PinballY receives results from
   PinEMHi.  This event can't be canceled, since the high scores have already
   been received.

</ul>

<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object.
</p>

<h2>When are high scores requested?</h2>

<p>
   PinballY normally requests high scores for a game when the game
   is first selected in the wheel UI.  Once the scores are obtained
   from this initial request, they're kept in memory, so that they
   can be used again the next time the game is selected.
</p>
<p>
   When you launch a game session, PinballY discards any
   cached scores for the launched game, just in case you set a
   new high score when playing.  PinballY will make a fresh request
   for the game's high scores the next time it's selected in UI,
   which usually happens as soon as you exit the game and return
   to the PinballY window.
</p>

<h2>Where does PinEMHi find score information?</h2>
<p>
   PinEMHi can read two sources of high score data:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>VPinMAME NVRAM files.  VPinMAME is the program that Visual
   Pinball uses to emulate ROM software for arcade game re-creations.
   In their original arcade incarnations, most solid-state pinball
   machines had special "non-volatile" memory (RAM) units that they
   used to store settings and high score information.  VPinMAME
   emulates this non-volatile RAM using disk files, so for any
   Visual Pinball game you've played on your machine, you'll find
   a corresponding NVRAM file in the VPinMAME folder tree.
   These files contain the exact byte layout that the original
   arcade ROMs used, so it can be pretty random looking to the
   naked eye.  PinEMHi uses reverse engineering information to
   decode the bytes of most of the known ROM-based games and
   retrieve the high score data contained therein.

   <li>Future Pinball NVRAM files.  Future Pinball doesn't use
   VPinMAME or ROM emulation.  Instead, it provides its own Visual
   Basic scripting that table authors use to re-create game rules.
   One of FP's scripting features is its own equivalent of VPinMAME's
   NVRAM files.  PinEMHi knows how to parse these files to retrieve
   high score data.
</ul>
<p>
   In both cases, PinballY automatically figures out where to
   find the relevant files based on program install paths.
</p>

<p>
   Note that PinEMHi only understands the two formats above.
   For example, it doesn't work with any of the commercial pinball
   game systems.  More subtly, it also doesn't work with any
   Visual Pinball games that don't use ROM emulation.  That
   excludes all electro-mechanical (EM) games as well as most
   "original" tables (those that aren't re-creations of arcade
   games).
</p>
   

<a name="customScores"></a>
<h2>Setting custom scores</h2>

<p>
   You can use the high score events to override or supplement
   the normal PinEMHi score retrieval mechanism.
</p>
<p>
   To <b>override</b> PinEMHi score retrieval for a given game,
   create a listener for the <b>highscoresrequest</b> event, and
   use <b><i>event</i>.preventDefault()</b> to cancel the event.
   This tells PinballY to abort the PinEMHi invocation.  PinballY
   will simply consider the game to have no high score information
   at that point until you supply your own custom data.
</p>
<p>
   To <b>supplement</b> PinEMHi score retrieval, create a listener
   for the <b>highscoresready</b> event, and check the <b>success</b>
   property of the event object.  If <b>success</b> is false, it
   means that PinEMHi was unable to retrieve the score data for
   the game.  You can use this to detect games that PinEMHi doesn't
   cover, such as Farsight <i>Pinball Arcade</i> games or Visual
   Pinball games that don't use ROM emulation.
</p>
<p>
   In either case, you can then call <a href="GameInfo.html#setHighScores"><b><i>gameInfo</i>.setHighScores()</b></a>
   to provide your own high score data for the game.  See the description
   of that method for more details.
</p>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>).  In addition, it
   has the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>game:</b> A <href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object identifying
   the game whose high scores are being requested or received.

   <li><b>scores:</b> For a <b>highscoresready</b> event only, this contains an
   array of strings giving the retrieved score information.

   <li><a name="source"></a><b>source:</b>  For a <b>highscoresready</b> event only,
   this is a string identifying the source of the score data.  This is one of the
   following string values:

   <ul>
      <li>"cache": the scores were already cached in memory for this game

      <li>"javascript": the data came from a <b>highscoresready</b> event
      that was canceled via <b>preventDefault()</b>

      <li>"pinemhi": the scores were retrieved via the PinEMHi program
   </ul>

   <li><b>success:</b>  For a <b>highscoresready</b> event only, a boolean
   indicating whether or not the request succeeded.  

</ul>
