<h1>Game Launch Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide the Windows taskbar while a game is running:</b>  
   This option is intended to make the transitions between PinballY
   and running games more seamless, graphically, by making sure
   that the Windows taskbar doesn't pop into view during
   game launches or when games are exiting.  This option
   simply hides the taskbar entirely any time a game is
   running.
</p>
<p>
   The reason this is optional is that Microsoft doesn't
   consider it good practice for applications to mess with
   the taskbar like this.  The taskbar is supposed to be the
   exclusive province of the Windows desktop.
   In this case, though, it's somewhat justifiable, as PinballY
   effectively serves as a replacement for the Windows desktop
   as long as you're operating in "pinball mode".  If you have
   any problems with the taskbar remaining hidden after you
   exit PinballY, or anything along those lines, disable this
   option to make PinballY behave itself with respect to the
   taskbar.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Terminate game when idle for (seconds):</b>  This sets
   an inactivity timeout period for launched games.  If you launch
   a game and then walk away from the system, not touching any
   buttons for a while, PinballY will terminate the game and
   return to its menu display when this timeout period expires.
   Set this to zero to disable the timeout entirely.
</p>
<p>
   The timeout won't kick in while you're actively playing a game,
   since it only takes effect when you haven't pressed any buttons
   for the timeout period.  So it doesn't limit the amount of time
   you can play a single game.  It's just there in case you walk
   away from the system while a game is running, to ensure that
   the system eventually returns to "attract mode" if left idle
   for a long time.
</p>


<p>
   <b>"Keep the following windows open...":</b>  These checkboxes
   let you tell PinballY to continue showing one or more of the
   PinballY windows when any game is running.  The selected windows
   will remain in the foreground and will continue to show their
   background graphics or videos throughout each game.
</p>
<p>
   Normally, PinballY blanks all of its windows while a game is running,
   and allows the running game to place its windows in front of the
   PinballY windows (to the extent they're situated in the same
   display area).  The assumption is that you want the game to take
   over the entire display while it's running, and that you don't
   want PinballY wasting CPU time and video memory by continuing to
   play back videos in windows that are covered up by the running game.
</p>
<p>
   However, you might want to keep some of the PinballY windows open
   while playing some or all games.  For example, none of the current
   player systems provide their own dedicated instruction card window,
   so if you have a physical monitor area that's suitable for an
   instruction card display, you can tell PinballY to keep its
   instruction card window active during play, by checking the
   Instruction Card box here.
</p>
<p>
   When you set a window to continue showing graphics while
   running, PinballY also forces that window into the "topmost"
   window layer on the monitor while the game is executing,
   so that the PinballY window stays in front of any window
   the game itself displays in the same screen area.
   This is an attempt to ensure that the PinballY window
   not only fills in for missing game graphics, but actually
   replaces any graphics the game tries to display in that
   screen area.  The idea is to let you replace any game
   graphics that you don't like with your own custom images
   or videos.  For example, some systems make a half-hearted attempt
   at backglass graphics by displaying a static image with
   no animation.  You might prefer to show the PinballY backglass
   video throughout play instead in such cases.  The automatic
   "topmost" layering helps ensure that the PinballY window
   will appear in front of the game system's window, effectively
   replacing it on the screen.  (This isn't absolutely guaranteed
   to keep the PinballY window in front, because the game could
   also lay claim to the "topmost" layer, in which case it will
   usually have precedence because it's the foreground application.
   You might need to resort to tweaking the game's settings in
   such a case to tell the game not to show the unwanted window.)
</p>
<p>
   The settings here are "global", meaning they apply as the
   defaults to all games.  You can also control which PinballY
   windows remain active on a per-system and per-game basis.
   If you want to select a set of windows that will remain
   active during play only for games of a particular system,
   you can do that using the <a href="SystemOptions.html">player
   system options</a> page for that system.  Each system's
   settings page has its own set of the checkboxes shown
   here where you can make the same selections for that
   individual system.  The settings for a system override
   the global settings here.  Similarly, the
   <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Game Details</a> dialog
   has its own set of these checkboxes, where you can
   override both the global settings and the system settings.
</p>
<p>
   <b>"DMD" vs. "Real DMD":</b>  The DMD checkbox refers to PinballY's
   on-screen window where it displays DMD-style graphics.  The Real DMD
   checkbox refers to your physical DMD device (such as a PinDMD or
   Pin2DMD unit), if you have one.  The Real DMD isn't a window, but the
   same principle applies: if you check this box, PinballY will continue
   to show its image or video media on your real DMD device while the
   game is running.  This will prevent the launched game from displaying
   anything on the DMD, since the real DMD devices only allow access from
   one program at a time.  (In some cases, a game that tries to access
   the device might detect the conflict and show an error, or exit
   abruptly, or even crash, so it's best to use this option only with
   games that don't try to access the DMD device themselves.)
