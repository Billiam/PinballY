<h1>Game Launch Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide the Windows taskbar while a game is running:</b>  
   This option is intended to make the transitions between PinballY
   and running games more seamless, graphically, by making sure
   that the Windows taskbar doesn't pop into view during
   game launches or when games are exiting.  This option
   simply hides the taskbar entirely any time a game is
   running.
</p>
<p>
   The reason this is optional is that Microsoft doesn't
   consider it good practice for applications to mess with
   the taskbar like this.  The taskbar is supposed to be the
   exclusive province of the Windows desktop.
   In this case, though, it's somewhat justifiable, as PinballY
   effectively serves as a replacement for the Windows desktop
   as long as you're operating in "pinball mode".  If you have
   any problems with the taskbar remaining hidden after you
   exit PinballY, or anything along those lines, disable this
   option to make PinballY behave itself with respect to the
   taskbar.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Terminate game when idle for (seconds):</b>  This sets
   an inactivity timeout period for launched games.  If you launch
   a game and then walk away from the system, not touching any
   buttons for a while, PinballY will terminate the game and
   return to its menu display when this timeout period expires.
   Set this to zero to disable the timeout entirely.
</p>
<p>
   The timeout won't kick in while you're actively playing a game,
   since it only takes effect when you haven't pressed any buttons
   for the timeout period.  So it doesn't limit the amount of time
   you can play a single game.  It's just there in case you walk
   away from the system while a game is running, to ensure that
   the system eventually returns to "attract mode" if left idle
   for a long time.
