<h1>gameList Object</h1>

<p>
   The gameList object represents the program's internal database of
   games.  Methods on this object provide Javascript access to the
   list of loaded games and their details.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   gameList is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   gameList serves as the event target for the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="gameList"></div>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
    The gameList object has the following properties and methods:
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.createCategory(<i>name</i>):</b>  Creates a new category with
   the given name.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.createFilter(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Defines a custom filter,
   which selects games for the wheel UI according to a selection rule
   you define.  <i>desc</i> is an object describing the filter.
   Returns a <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a>, automatically
   assigned as a unique menu command for the filter.  You can use
   the command ID to place the filter on custom menus.   See
   <a href="FilterInfo.html#custom">Custom Filters</a> for details
   and examples.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="deleteCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.deleteCategory(<i>name</i>):</b>  Deletes the given
   category.  The category tag is removed from any games tagged with
   the given category, and the category is removed from the master
   list of categories returned by gameList.getAllCategories().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllCategories"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllCategories():</b>  Returns an array with the names
   of all of the categories currently defined.  Categories are arbitrary
   tags, defined by the user, that can be assigned to games for filtering
   purposes.  Each category implicitly defines a "category filter" that
   the user can select through the menu system to show only games with
   the corresponding category tag.  This lets the user select subsets of
   games based on personal criteria beyond the built-in filter options
   that the system provides.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllFilters"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllFilters():</b>  Returns an array of filter IDs
   for all available filters.  Each element is a <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllGames"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllGames():</b>  Returns an array consisting of a
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for each loaded games.  The
   array is arranged in wheel display order, which is alphabetical by
   the display name of each game.  If you need to iterate over all games,
   this is more efficient than calling getGame() for each game.  In
   addition, the returned array is a snapshot of the complete game list at
   the time you call this function, so it isn't be affected by subsequent
   insertions, deletions, or reorderings of the live game list, as
   getGame() is.  This makes it suitable for making edits to the live
   game list in the course of the iteration, since edits to the live list
   won't affect the snapshot and thus won't affect the iteration.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllWheelGames"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllWheelGames():</b>  Returns an array consisting of a
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for each game on the wheel.
   That is, each game selected by the currently active filter.
   The first (0th) element of the array represents the currently selected game.
   Each subsequent element represents the next game to the right on the wheel.
   Since the wheel is conceptually circular, the last element is the game
   displayed in the wheel one position left from the current game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getCurFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.getCurFilter():</b>  Returns a <href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the filter currently selected in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getFilterInfo"></a>
   <b>gameList.getFilterInfo(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the filter identified by <i>id</i>.  The <i>id</i> value is a string
   with the filter ID.  See <a href="FilterInfo.html#filterID">FilterInfo</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGameInfo"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGameInfo(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object, which has properties to access most of the details of the specified game.
   <i>id</i> can be either a <a href="GameInfo.html#configID">config ID</a> string
   (the permanent identifier for a game, suitable for storing in an external location
   such as a config file) or a numeric <a href="GameInfo.html#gameID">game ID</a>
   (the internal ID that refers to the in-memory record for a loaded game).
   If the ID is invalid or refers to a game that's no longer loaded, the function
   returns null.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGame"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGame(<i>n</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object representing the <i>n</i>th game in the loaded game list.  <i>n</i> is an
   index into the list of all loaded games, ranging from 0 to the number of games
   in the list minus 1.  Returns null if <i>n</i> is out of range.  You can get the
   total number of games currently in the list from getGameCount().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGameCount"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGameCount():</b>  Returns the number of games in the list of
   all loaded games.  You can retrieve individual games via getGame(<i>n</i>),
   where <i>n</i> ranges from 0 to the game count minus 1.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getWheelGame"></a>
   <b>gameList.getWheelGame(<i>n</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object representing the game at offset <i>n</i> from the selected game in the wheel.  The
   currently selected game is at offset 0, so gameList.getWheelGame(0) refers
   to the current game.  Offset 1 is the next game to the right of the
   current game, 2 is the next game to the right of that, and so on; -1 is
   the game to the left of the current game, -2 is the game to the left of
   that, and so on.  Since the wheel is conceptually a circle, offset <i>N</i>
   comes back to the currently selected game when <i>N</i> is the number
   of games showing on the wheel (and by the same token, offset <i>-N</i>,
   2<i>N</i>, <i>-2N</i>, etc all wrap back to the current game).
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getWheelCount"></a>
   <b>gameList.getWheelCount():</b>  Returns the number of games currently
   shown in the "wheel" UI.  This includes all games selected by the current
   filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="renameCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.renameCategory(<i>oldName</i>, <i>newName</i>):</b>  Renames
   the given category.  An error occurs if the category referenced by <i>oldName</i>
   doesn't exist, or if there's already an existing category with the new name.
   The category tag is renamed globally, so any games tagged with the old category
   name are updated to the new name.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="setCurFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.setCurFilter(<i>id</i>):</b>  Changes the active filter
   for the wheel UI.  <i>id</i> can a string with the ID of the desired
   filter, or a number in the range command.FilterFirst to command.FilterLast
   (see <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>), identifying the filter by
   its associated menu command.  The <a href="FilterSelectEvent.html"><b>filterselect</b></a>
   event is <b>not</b> fired when you change the filter with this function.
