<h1>mainWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>mainWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the main user
   interface window (the "playfield" window).  This window is the event target
   for most UI-related events, and in many ways it serves as the Javascript
   object that represents the overall PinballY application.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   mainWindow is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   mainWindow serves as the event target for the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="mainWindow"></div>


<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   The mainWindow object provides the <a href="WindowObjects.html#common">common
   window methods and properties</a>.  It also provides the additional
   items listed below.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="doCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.doCommand(<i>id</i>):</b>  Executes the command specified by
   <i>id</i>, which is one of the integer command codes in the
   <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> set.  This function carries out a
   menu-level command, as opposed to a button-level command; for the latter,
   use doButtonCommand().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="doButtonCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.doButtonCommand(<i>command</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>repeat</i>):</b>
   Simulates a key press, or more precisely, simulates a processed key event
   that corresponds to <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>.
   This carries out the effect of a named button command, specified by the
   string <i>command</i>.  The valid command names are the values listed for the
   .command property of the <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>
   object.  <i>down</i> is a boolean indicating if this simulates a key press
   (true) or a key-up event (false) representing the user releasing the key.
   <i>repeat</i> is a boolean indicating if this should represent an auto-repeat
   event.  <i>repeat</i> is only meaningful when <i>down</i> is true, for obvious
   reasons.  Because the simulated key press is coming from Javascript already,
   it doesn't generate any of the usual Javascript events for actual key presses;
   it just carries out the effect of the key command.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="endAttractMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.endAttractMode():</b>  Exits "Attract Mode" if it's currently
   active.  There's no effect if the program isn't already in attract mode.
   The <a href="AttractModeEvent.html"><b>attractmodeend</b></a> event isn't
   fired when you use this method.

<p>
   <a name="getActiveWindow"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getActiveWindow():</b>  Returns the <a href="WindowObjects.html">window object</a> (mainWindow,
   <a href="BackglassWindow.html">backglassWindow</a>, etc) corresponding to the
   current active window in the application.  This is the active window at the
   operating system level, which means that it's in the foreground and has
   keyboard focus.  If the application is currently in the background, none
   of the windows are active, so this returns null.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getKeyCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getKeyCommand(<i>descriptor</i>):</b>  Returns an array of
   the button commands assigned to the given key or joystick button.  <i>descriptor</i>
   is an object describing the key or button to look up.  This can be in one of the
   following formats:
</p>
<div class="code">
{ type: "key", vkey: <i>integer</i> };  // look up by virtual key (vkey) from key event
{ type: "key", code: <i>string</i> };   // look up by key code from key event
{ type: "joystick", unit: <i>integer</i>, button: <i>integer</i> };  // joystick button
</div>
<p>
   This is the same information provided to your event listener in a
   <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a> or <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a>
   object, so it's easy to look up the command information in one of those
   handlers.
</p>
<p>
   The command names in the returned array are the same names used in the
   .command property of the <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>
   object.  An array is returned because it's possible for a user to assign multiple
   commands to the same keyboard key or joystick button.  Pressing a key with multiple
   commands assigned carries out each of the commands in sequence.
</p>
   
<p>
   <a name="getUIMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getUIMode():</b>  Returns an object describing the current UI
   state.  Here's a quick summary of the object's contents:
</p>
<div class="code">
{
    mode: "wheel",         // see list
    game: (object),        // GameInfo object for currently selected game in wheel
    menuID: "main",        // see list; present only in "menu" mode
    popupID: "about box",  // see list; present only in "popup" mode
    runMode: "running",    // or "starting", "exiting"; present only when a game is running
    capture: "single"      // or "batch"; present only when running a game in media capture mode
}
</div>
<p>
   The main state is given by the property .mode, which has one of the values
   listed below.  Depending on the mode, other properties of the object might
   be present to provide additional information.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"wheel": in the normal game wheel UI, awaiting a command

   <li>"menu": a menu is being displayed (this refers to the graphical
   menu that PinballY displays as an overlay in the playfield window, not
   a standard Windows menu).  In this case, the .menuID property of the
   mode object will contain a string identifying which particular menu
   is being displayed.  See <a href="Menus.html#systemMenus">system menus</a>
   for a list of the built-in menus and their identifiers.

   <li>"popup": a popup box is being displayed.  The .popupID property of
   the mode object is a string specifying the type of popup.  See
   <a href="Popups.html#systemPopups">system popups</a> for a list
   of the system popup types.

   <li>"running": a running game is in progress.  Note that "menu" mode can
   supersede this, since the user can still bring up menus while a game is
   running.  You can determine for sure whether or not a game is running by
   checking for the presence of another property, .runMode, which will be
   present if and only if a game is running.  If present,
   .runMode will be set to the string "starting" (the game has been launched
   but hasn't opened its UI window yet), "running" (the game is in progress),
   or "exiting" (PinballY has closed the game and is waiting for the process
   to exit).  In addition, if the game is running for the purposes of media
   capture, the property .capture will be present, and will be set to the
   string "single" for a single-game capture or "batch" for a batch capture.

   <li>"attract": attract mode/screen saver mode (meaning that there hasn't
   been any user input for the period of time configured in the settings to
   activate attract mode)
</ul>
<p>
   The .game property identifies the game that's currently selected in
   the wheel, if any.  This is present regardless of which UI mode is
   in effect.  This is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object,
   which has properties that access the game's details.
   The .game property will be omitted (so it'll read as undefined) if no
   game is selected, which can only happen when the wheel is completely
   empty.  The wheel can be empty when the program can't find any
   installed games, or when a filter is selected that doesn't match
   any games.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="message"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.message(<i>message</i>, <i>style</i>):</b>  Shows a message
   using a graphical popup box in the main window.  Unlike the global alert()
   function, this doesn't pause the script until the user acknowledges the
   message; it simply shows or queues the message and returns immediately.
   This is a good option for showing error messages or status updates, since
   it doesn't interrupt the flow of the user interface with a modal dialog.
   If <i>style</i> is provided, it's a string value specifying the
   visual style of the popup message.  This can be "info", "warning", or
   "error", to show the message with green, orange, or red trim
   (respectively), to visually signal the nature of the message.  The
   regular "info" style is used if <i>style</i> is omitted.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="playButtonSound"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.playButtonSound(<i>name</i>):</b>  Plays a button sound effect.
   These are the same system sound effects played when the user presses various
   buttons.  Does nothing if button sounds are muted in the user's option settings.
   The available effect names are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>AddCredit:</b> played when a coin is inserted and a full credit is added
   <li><b>CoinIn:</b> played when a coin is inserted and a fractional credit is added
   <li><b>Deselect:</b> played when closing a menu or popup
   <li><b>Next:</b> played when switching to the next game, menu item, or popup page
   <li><b>Prev:</b> played when switching to the previous game, menu item, or popup page
   <li><b>Select:</b> played when showing a menu or selecting a menu item
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="playGame"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.playGame(<i>game</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Launches a game.
   <i>game</i> is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for the game to
   be launched.  <i>options</i> is an object with properties specifying option
   settings; this whole argument can be omitted, in which case defaults are
   used for all options.  If you do include the object argument, you only
   have to specify the properties for options you want to override; any
   missing properties will use the corresponding defaults.  Here are the
   possible <i>options</i> properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>command:</b>  An integer giving the command code that the game is
   nominally launched under.  The default is
   <a href="commands.html#PlayGame">command.PlayGame</a>, which is also
   the command that the system itself uses to launch games for normal
   play (as opposed to media capture).  The command you specify here has
   no effect on how PinballY itself handles the launch process, but it's
   reported to your event handlers as the command code in all of the
   <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a> events reported that fire
   during the launch, so you can use it as the basis of any custom
   handling you want to perform during the launch.

   <li><b>system:</b>  A <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object
   specifying which system to use to launch the game.  The default
   is the system associated with the game in the game database, or the
   system associated with the table directory where the game file is located.
   If it's not possible for PinballY to uniquely determine the system from
   one of those sources, you <b>must</b> specify this option to tell the
   program which system to use.  Note that PinballY doesn't try to second-guess
   your choice of system here; it'll let you run any game file with any system.
   But for obvious reasons, the launched program will probably show an error,
   crash, or otherwise fail to work properly if you try to launch it with
   a game file designed for a different system.

   <li><b>overrides:</b>  An optional object value specifying overrides for
   the normal launch parameters.  The parameters are specified via the
   object's properties.  These are the same
   properties that can be set in the <b>override</b> property
   of a <b>prelaunch</b> event; see <a href="LaunchEvent.html#overrideProperties">override properties</a>
   for the list of properties and their meanings.
   <p>
      You can specify any
      subset of the override properties.  The normal system launch parameters
      are used for any properties you omit from the override set.  For example,
      if you want to change the "show window" mode but use the rest of the
      normal the launch parameters unchanged, you could do something
      like this:
   </p>

   <div class="code">
mainWindow.playGame(game, undefined, { swShow: SW_HIDE });
   </div>
   
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="showMenu"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.showMenu(<i>id</i>, <i>items</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Display a custom
   menu in the main window, in the same style as the main menu, exit menu, etc.
   See <a href="Menus.html">Menus</a> for more details.  The <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menuopen</b></a>
   event isn't fired when you use this method.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="showPopup"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.showPopup(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Display a custom popup dialog
   in the main window, in the style of the standard system popups (e.g., game
   information, high scores, ratings entry).   See
   <a href="Popups.html#custom">Custom Popups</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="startAttractMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.startAttractMode():</b>  Enters "Attract Mode", the screen saver
   mode that normally kicks in automatically after a period without any user input
   (the exact amount of time is configurable in the settings).  This function
   lets you create your own conditions for entering attract mode. 
   The <a href="AttractModeEvent.html"><b>attractmodestart</b></a> event isn't
   fired when you use this method.
</p>

<p>
   <b>mainWindow.statusLines:</b>  An object containing references to the
   <a href="StatusLine.html">StatusLine</a> objects representing the on-screen
   status line displays.  The object has the following properties:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>upper:</b>  The upper line of the main two-line status area
   <li><b>lower:</b>  The lower line of the main two-line status area
   <li><b>attract:</b>  The single-line status area that replaces the main status
   area when attract mode is active
</ul>
