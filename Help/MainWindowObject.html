<h1>mainWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>mainWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the main user
   interface window (the "playfield" window).  This window is the event target
   for most UI-related events.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   mainWindow is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>


<p>
   <a name="message"></a>
   <b>message(<i>message</i>, <i>style</i>):</b>  Shows a message using a
   graphical popup box in the main window.  Unlike the global alert() function,
   this doesn't pause the script until the user acknowledges the message;
   it simply shows or queues the message and returns immediately.  This
   is a good option for showing error messages or status updates, since it
   doesn't interrupt the flow of the user interface with a modal dialog.
   If <i>style</i> is provided, it's a string value specifying the
   visual style of the popup message.  This can be "info", "warning", or
   "error", which show the message with green, orange, or red trim
   (respectively), to visually signal the nature of the message.  The
   regular "info" style is used if <i>style</i> is omitted.
</p>


<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
   <b>keydown:</b> This keyboard event fires when a keyboard key is pressed,
    and is then repeated each time Windows sends an "auto repeat" event
    while the key is being held down.
</p>

<p>
   <b>keyup:</b> This keyboard event fires when a keyboard key is released.
