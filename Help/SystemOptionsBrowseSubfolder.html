<h1>System Setup - Browse Subfolders</h1>

<p>
   You can browse for available folders for the Media or Database folder
   settings by clicking the folder icon (<img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="folderIcon.png">)
   next to the text box where you enter the folder name.  This will show
   a list of the existing folders in the corresponding base folder.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>It's fine to leave the folder name completely blank.  This will
   use the default folder for the system, which has the same name as
   the system.  For example, if the system name entered in the system
   options dialog is <b>Visual Pinball 9.2</b>, the default folder will
   also be called <b>Visual Pinball 9.2</b>.
   
   <li>You can select an existing folder by clicking on it, or you can
   enter the name of a new folder in the "Folder Name" text box.  The new
   folder won't be created immediately, but PinballY will create it the
   first time you perform some operation that requires storing a file there.

   <li>You can only browse through the immediate subfolders of the main
   folder for this item, as set in the Folders options.  The main folder
   is global to all of PinballY, so you can't change this individually
   for each game system.  For a Media subfolder, you can only select a
   folder contained directly in the base Media folder.  For a Table Database
   subfolder, you can only select a folder contained directly in the main
   Table Database folder.
</ul>
