<h1>Mouse Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide the mouse pointer by moving it off-screen:</b>
   PinballY automatically the mouse pointer at program
   startup and any time you press a command button, as part of
   its goal of hiding Windows as much as possible and making your
   pin cab look like an arcade machine.  On some machines, though
   (and for reasons we don't understand), the normal Windows
   "hide the mouse" commands don't work.  This option is meant
   to come to the rescue if you have one of those machines
   where the mouse refuses to be silenced.
</p>
<p>
   This option "hides" the mouse simply by moving it to some
   corner of the screen where it won't be visible, or if that's
   not possible, where it at least won't be in the way.
</p>
<p>
   You probably won't want to select this option unless the mouse
   refuses to disappear on your system.  This option can be a little annoying
   if you don't need it, since the mouse will keep jumping
   off to the far corner of the screen, forcing you to drag
   it back every time you want to use it.
</p>
<p>
   To use this option, check the box, and select the coordinates
   where you want to park the mouse in lieu of hiding it.  You
   can type the coordinates (in screen pixels) into the box
   directly, or more simply, you can click the "Select with
   mouse" button, and then move the mouse to the desired location
   and click the mouse button.
