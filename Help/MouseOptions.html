<h1>Mouse Options</h1>

<p>
   <b>Hide the mouse pointer by moving it off-screen:</b>
   This option instructs PinballY to hide the mouse cursor when
   necessary by moving it to a selected screen location, rather than
   by making the cursor itself invisible.  By default (when this
   option isn't selected), an invisible cursor is used when the
   mouse needs to be hidden.
</p>
<p>
   Whether or not this option is chosen, PinballY always tries
   to hide the mouse cursor at program startup and whenever you
   press a keyboard key or joystick button.  The idea is to
   make the experience more arcade-like by hiding the fact
   that there's a mouse.  Most of the time, you can operate
   the program entirely with buttons/keys, so the mouse isn't
   needed and is just an unwanted reminder that this is a
   Windows PC and not a real pinball machine.
</p>
<p>
   The reason this option exists is that the cursor can't be
   made invisible on some systems (for reasons not understood).
   This provides an alternative for such systems, by moving
   the mouse to a corner of the screen where it won't be visible,
   or at least won't be in the way.
</p>
<p>
   You probably won't want to select this option unless the mouse
   refuses to disappear with the default mode.  This option can be
   a little annoying if you don't need it, since the mouse will keep
   jumping off to the far corner of the screen, forcing you to drag
   it back every time you want to use it.
</p>
<p>
   To use this option, check the box, and select the coordinates
   where you want to park the mouse in lieu of hiding it.  You
   can type the coordinates (in screen pixels) into the box
   directly, or more simply, use the "Drag here to select"
   button: <b>press and hold</b> the left mouse button,
   move the mouse to the desired parking position (while still
   holding the button), and release the button when you get
   to the desired location.
