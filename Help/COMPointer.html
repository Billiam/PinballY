<h1>COMPointer Objects</h1>

<p>
   A COMPointer object represents a pointer to a native Windows
   COM object.  This is a Javascript object that stores a native
   COM object pointer internally, allowing you to work with
   the COM interface from Javascript as though it were a normal
   Javascript object.
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   It's a little tricky to think about COMPointer objects because
   of their dual nature.  A COMPointer is a Javascript object that
   represents a native pointer.  The COMPointer construct is
   designed to make the two appear as one entity as much as
   possible, but you have to be aware of the two pieces during
   the creation process.
</p>
<p>
   The first step in the creation process is to create the
   Javascript portion of the object.  You do this the same way
   you create all other native object types, by calling
   dllImport.create(), in this case with the type signature
   of a COM interface pointer:
</p>
<div class="code">
let pCreateDeviceEnum = dllImport.create("ICreateDevEnum*");
</div>

<p>
   A COM pointer is always a C pointer type, so the type name is
   always a COM interface name followed by a "*" (for "pointer").
</p>
<p>
   The second step is to create the underlying COM object.
   The call to dllImport.create() created the Javascript portion
   of the object, but remember that there's also a native COM object
   pointer hidden inside that Javascript object.  dllImport.create()
   <i>doesn't</i> create that part.  It just sets the hidden internal
   native pointer inside the new COMPointer object to "null", meaning
   that there's no actual native COM object associated with it yet.
</p>
<p>
   The reason that dllImport.create() doesn't create the COM
   object automatically is that you haven't said how to do that
   yet.  There are several ways to create COM objects, so
   dllImport.create() can't guess at what you intend.
   COM object creation isn't like C or Javascript object
   creation where new objects are created with a built-in
   language keyword like "new".  Instead, you have to use COM
   APIs to create COM objects.  There are many ways such APIs,
   but they mostly fall into three categories:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The global API function CoCreateInstance()

   <li>QueryInterface() on an existing COM object

   <li>Other interface methods on existing COM objects
</ul>

<p>
   In every one of these cases, the standard COM formulation
   is to call one of these functions or interface methods,
   passing in the address of a pointer variable that will
   receive the new interface pointer.  That's where our
   thus-far "empty" COMPointer object - the one we created
   above via dllImport.create() - comes into play.  For this
   example, we'll use CoCreateInstance() to create our object:
</p>
<div class="code">
const CLSID_SystemDeviceEnum = "62BE5D10-60EB-11d0-BD3B-00A0C911CE86";
let hr = COM.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_SystemDeviceEnum, null, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, pCreateDeviceEnum);
</div>

<p>
   That function creates a new native COM object, and stores
   the resulting native pointer in our pCreateDeviceEnum object.
   Our Javascript variable still contains the same object
   reference as before, but that object's hidden internal
   COM pointer now points to a real COM interface rather
   than a NULL pointer.  We can now call the methods defined
   on the interface, which will invoke the corresponding
   native COM code.
</p>

<p>
   Note that we took advantage of the special handling in the
   native COM call mechanism that lets us pass a COMPointer
   object (pCreateDeviceEnum) to represent <b>two parameters</b>
   in the function signature.  See "IID_PPV_ARGS" below.
</p>


<h2>Special handling for IID_PPV_ARGS</h2>

<p>
   In COM functions, there's a common pattern in methods that return
   new interface pointers, where you pass a pair of arguments
   known as IID_PPV_ARGS.  That stands for "Interface ID, pointer
   to pointer to void arguments".  The term IID_PPV_ARGS is the
   name of a C macro in the standard COM SDK headers, which they
   created because it's so pervasive in COM functions.
</p>
<p>
   The canonical example is IUnknown::QueryInterface, which takes
   the following arguments:
</p>
<div class="code">
HRESULT QueryInterface(REFIID, void**);
</div>

<p>
   The REFIID is a reference to an IID or Interface ID, which is
   just another name for a GUID, "globally unique identifier".
   GUIDs are those 32-character hex strings that identify COM
   interfaces and classes.
</p>
<p>
   The "void**" is a "</i>pointer to</i> a pointer to void".
   That's a double level of pointer indirection, which is awfully
   hard to visualize if you're used to Javascript, and not much
   easier for most C programmers.  All you really have to know
   about it here is that it's an "out" parameter that will
   <i>receive a pointer on return</i> to a COM interface.
</p>

<p>
   In C and C++, the IID_PPV_ARGS macro we mentioned lets you
   call functions with REFIID,void** pairs using a single COM
   interface pointer variable.  The reason this is possible is
   that a COM pointer variable is declared with its GUID, so
   the one variable contains both pieces of information needed
   by the function.  Here's how the call might look in C++:
</p>
<div class="code">
IPersistStream *ips;
if (SUCCESS(obj->QueryInterface(IID_PPV_ARGS(ips)))) ...
</div>
   
<p>
   The Javascript-to-native calling mechanism has special handling
   that simulates the IID_PPV_ARGS macro.  But in this case, you don't
   even have to use the macro; the Javascript engine recognizes the
   pattern automatically from the function arguments.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the rule:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the function requires a pair of arguments of type
   REFIID, void**;

   <li>And you pass a COMPointer argument in the REFIID position;

   <li>Then the Javascript-to-native mechanism gets the GUID from
   the COMPointer object, and passes a pointer to the COMPointer's
   internal native pointer as the void** argument
</ul>

<p>
   So in Javascript, the equivalent of the C++ example above is
   even simpler:
</p>
<div class="code">
let ips = dllImport.create("IPersistStream*");
let hr = obj->QueryInterface(ips);
</div>

<h2>Calling COM methods</h2>

<p>
   Once you've created the Javascript COMPointer object via
   dllImport.create(), and populated the internal COM pointer
   via CoCreateInstance(), QueryInterface(), or some other
   COM API, you can call the COM interface's methods directly,
   as though they were ordinary Javascript methods on the
   COMPointer object.
</p>

<div class="code">
const CLSID_SystemDeviceEnum = "62BE5D10-60EB-11d0-BD3B-00A0C911CE86";
let pCreateDevEnum = dllImport.create("ICreateDevEnum*");
let hr = COM.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_SystemDeviceEnum, null, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, pCreateDevEnum);

let pEnumMoniker = dllImport.create("IEnumMoniker*");
hr = pCreateDevEnum.CreateClassEnumerator("33D9A762-90C8-11d0-BD43-00A0C911CE86", pEnumMoniker, 0);

for (;;)
{
    let pMoniker = dllImport.create("IMoniker*");
    if (pEnumMoniker.Next(1, pMoniker, null) != 0)
        break;
}
</div>

<h2>AddRef and Release</h2>

<p>
   In most cases, <b>you shouldn't call AddRef() or Release()</b> on COMPointer
   objects.  The reference counting should be automatic for most use cases,
   so you shouldn't have to worry about these the way you do in C/C++ code.
</p>
<p>
   The basic COM rules require that the constructor of
   an object - CoCreateInstance(), QueryInterface(), etc - will always add
   a reference count on behalf of the caller.  So you don't have to make
   your own AddRef() call when creating a new object or retrieving an
   interface.
</p>
<p>
   The COMPointer object itself automatically calls Release() when the
   Javascript object is deleted by the garbage collector.  So you don't
   have to call Release() when you're done with the object; just let
   Javascript clean it up automatically, like any other Javascript object.
</p>
<p>
   In fact, it's important that you <i>don't</i> call Release() on a
   COMPointer object yourself, <i>unless</i> you made a matching call
   to AddRef() earlier.  You must exactly balance each call you
   make to AddRef() with a corresponding call to Release().  But
   you musn't call Release() more times than you called AddRef()
   on the same object, because that could cause the underlying
   COM object to be deleted while the COMPointer object is still
   holding its reference to it, which could result in memory
   corruption and crash the program.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to explicitly free the underlying COM object at a
   particular point in time, rather than waiting for Javascript
   to delete it as part of the normal automatic garbage collection
   procedure, use COMPointer.clear().
</p>
   
<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   The methods on a COM pointer object are defined by the COM interface,
   and have the same names as the members of the interface.  You call
   these like ordinary Javascript methods:
</p>
<div class="code">
let p = dllImport.create("IMyInterface*");
let other = dllImport.create("ISubInterface*");
let hr = CoCreateInstance(CLSID_MyClass, null, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, p);
hr = p.QueryInterface(other);
</div>

<p>
   The Javascript COMPointer class adds some additional <i>class</i> methods.
   These are defined on the class rather than the individual instance
   objects, to avoid any possibility of naming conflicts with methods
   defined in COM interfaces.
</p>

<p>
   <b>COMPointer.clear(<i>comPointer</i>)</b>: Releases the Javascript
   reference on the underlying COM object, and sets the internal hidden
   pointer in the COMPointer object to null.  You can call this to
   explicitly release the underlying COM object at a particular point
   in time, so that the native object can be deleted if it's no longer
   needed by any other callers.
</p>
<p>
   You don't normally have to call this method, because the COMPointer
   object automatically releases its reference on the COM object
   when the Javascript garbage collector deletes the COMPointer
   object itself.  In most cases it's simpler to let Javascript
   handle this automatically.  The only drawback is that the garbage
   collector's timing is unpredictable, so a COM object might stay
   around for a while after you're done with it if you wait for
   automatic collection.  It might be desirable in some cases to
   explicitly release a COM object as soon as you know you're
   done with it, such as when the object holds a system resource
   that shouldn't be held longer than necessary.
</p>

<p>
   <b>COMPointer.isNull(<i>comPointer</i>)</b>: Returns true if the 
   internal native COM interface pointer in the object is null, false
   if it's populated with a live COM object instance.
</p>
