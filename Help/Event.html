<h1>Event Class</h1>

<p>
   This is the base class for all event objects.  The system
   creates an Event object each time a listenable event occurs,
   storing the details of what happened in properties of the
   Event object.  The Event object is passed as a parameter to
   each event listener method registered for the event.  For
   example, when the user presses a key on the keyboard, the
   system creates an Event object with properties describing
   which key was pressed, then passes this object as a parameter
   to each "keydown" event listener registered with the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>

<p>
   There are several subclasses of Event used for specific
   types of events.  These all have the basic properties and
   methods of the Event base class, and add their own
   additional properties of their own that describe the
   details of the specific type of event they represent.

<h2>Common properties</h2>

<p>
   All Event objects have a set of basic properties, regardless
   of the event type.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>bubbles:</b>  A boolean indicating if the event "bubbles".  Bubbling
       is a concept from the Web browser event model, indicating if the event
       is sent to parent HTML elements after being sent to the one where it
       actually occurs.  This doesn't currently apply to any PinballY objects,
       so this property is always false, but it's included in the object for
       the sake of familiarity and in case it becomes relevant in the future.

   <li><b>cancelable:</b>  A boolean indicating if the event can be canceled.
       If true, Event.preventDefault() can be used to stop the default system
       action from occurring; if false, the system action will always occur
       whether or not you call preventDefault().  (This is read-only; you can't
       change it for a system event.)

   <li><b>defaultPrevented:</b>  Returns true if preventDefault() has been called
      on the event, false if not.

       
   <li><b>timestamp:</b>  A number containing the Date.now() value when the
       event was fired.
       
   <li><b>type:</b>  A string with the name of the event ("keydown", "keyup", etc)
</ul>

<h2>Common methods</h2>
<p>
   All Event objects have a set of basic methods, regardless of
   the event type.
</p>
<ul>
      

   <li><b>preventDefault():</b>  Call this method to tell the system to skip the
      normal default processing for the event.  This will have no effect unless
      the event can be canceled, as indicated by the <b>cancelable</b> property.

   <li><b>stopPropagation():</b>  Stop "bubbling" for the event.  This prevents
      the event from being dispatched to listeners in parent objects, if the
      event bubbles from child to parent.  This doesn't affect other event
      listeners on the same target; use stopImmediatePropagation() to prevent
      any other listeners from being called.  No current
      PinballY events use bubbling, so this currently has no effect.

   <li><b>stopImmediatePropagation():</b>  Stop propagating the event to any
      other listeners.  This prevents any other listeners registered in the
      same event target from being called after this listener returns.  (Other
      listeners that were already called <i>before</i> this listener was
      invoked obviously aren't affected, as they can't be "un-called".)
      If the event uses bubbling (dispatching the event to parent objects),
      this also stops any parent object listeners from being called.
</ul>
