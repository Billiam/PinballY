<h1>Metafilters</h1>

<p>
   A "metafilter" is a global filter that's always active <i>in addition
   to</i> the current "regular" user-selected filter (e.g., an era
   or ratings filter).  This allows a metafilter to
   further narrow the list of games selected by the current regular filter,
   or even to override the regular filter's decisions by ruling in
   some of the games that the regular filter ruled out.
</p>
<p>
   Metafilters are useful for additional layers of filtering that you
   want to keep in effect at all times while still letting the user
   select games with the regular filters.  For example, a metafilter
   could be used for a "family mode" setting that excludes games that
   you've marked as having adult themes.  While this family metafilter
   is in effect, the user can still filter games normally (by era,
   by rating, etc), but adult-themed games will be excluded no matter
   what other filter is selected.  For a worked example of how to
   create this type of filter, see <a href="FamilyFilterExample.html">Family Filter</a>.
</p>

<p>
   Currently, there are no built-in metafilters, so any metafilters
   in effect will always be Javascript add-ons.
</p>

<h2>Creating a metafilter</h2>

<p>
   To create a metafilter, you call <a href="GameList.html#createMetaFilter">gameList.createMetaFilter(<i>desc</i>)</a>.
   The argument <i>desc</i> is an object the describes the new metafilter
   via its properties.  The properties of this object are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>after:</b>  An optional function that's called at the end of
   a selection cycle, after the last call to <b>select</b> for the cycle.
   This lets the metafilter do any desired clean-up (such as forgetting
   any large cached objects, to free up memory that's no longer needed).
   This can be omitted if no clean-up work is required
   
   <li><b>before:</b>  An optional function that's called at the start of
   a selection cycle, before the first call to <b>select</b> on each
   cycle.  This lets the metafilter do any preparation, such
   as caching information that applies to this selection run.  This can
   be omitted if no prep work is required on each cycle.

   <li><b>includeExcluded:</b>  An optional boolean specifying whether
   or not the <b>select</b> function should be called for games that
   are excluded by the regular filter or the previous metafilter.  This
   is false by default, meaning that the <b>select</b> function <i>won't</i>
   see games excluded by the other filters, and hence can only narrow
   the selection list decided upon by the other filters.  If you set
   this to true, the <b>select</b> function will be called for every
   game in the collection, even for games that were excluded by the
   other current filters, which allows it to rule games back in even
   after they've been ruled out by the other filters.  You can tell
   that a game was excluded by the other filters by checking the
   <i>included</i> argument to the <b>select</b> function.

   <li><b>priority:</b>  An optional number value giving the execution
   order for this metafilter relative to any other metafilters that are
   also in effect at the same time.  This lets you control which metafilter
   gets the final say on each game.  See <a href="#priority">Multiple
   metafilters and the priority order</a> below.

   <li><b>select:</b>  Required.  A function that's called once for each
   game, to test to see if the game should be included in the final
   selection set.  This function is called like this:
   <p class="indented">
      select(<i>game</i>, <i>included</i>)
   </p>
   <p>
      <i>game</i> is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object
      describing the game to be tested for inclusion.  <i>included</i>
      is a boolean value indicating whether or not the game is in the
      selection set for the current "regular" filter and for the
      previous metafilter (if other metafilters are in effect).
      The function returns true if the game should be included in
      the final selection set, false if the game should be excluded.
   </p>

</ul>
<p>
   The return value from gameList.createMetaFilter() is an opaque
   identifier that you can use to later remove the filter via
   <a href="GameList.html#removeMetaFilter">gameList.removeMetaFilter()</a>.
</p>

<h2>Removing a metafilter</h2>

<p>
   Once created, a metafilter stays in effect until it's explicitly
   removed.  Changes to the current main filter selection don't affect it,
   and the creation or removal or other metafilters don't affect it.
</p>
<p>
   To remove a metafilter, call <a href="GameList.html#removeMetaFilter">gameList.removeMetaFilter()</a>,
   passing the identifier returned from the call to gameList.createMetaFilter() that
   originally created the filter.
</p>

<a name="priority"></a>
<h2>Multiple metafilters and the priority order</h2>

<p>
   Metafilters always have the last say on the filtered game list,
   because the metafilters are called after the current regular
   filter has been called.  The metafilters therefore override
   the regular filter: if the regular filter rules a game in,
   but a metafilter then rules it out, the game is out.
</p>
<p>
   But what if there are multiple metafilters in effect?  This is
   specifically allowed, so we have to consider how they negotiate
   for control over the final decision.
</p>
<p>
   The main point of negotiation is the <b>priority</b> setting for
   each filter.
   When multiple metafilters are simultaneously active, PinballY calls them
   in ascending numeric order of their priorities.  For example,
   if metafilter A has priority 1000, and metafilter B has priority 2000,
   A's <b>select</b> function will be called first for each game (because
   it has the lower numeric value for the priority), and then B's
   <b>select</b> function will be called after that.
</p>
<p>
   In most situations, going first is the privileged position.  In
   this case, though, going <i>last</i> is where all the power lies.
   This is because each metafilter's decision replaces the prior
   filter's decision.  There's no concept of voting or combining
   the decisions; the last filter called simply has the last say.
</p>

<h2>Narrowing vs. widening metafilters</h2>

<p>
   Most metafilters are "narrowing" filters, meaning that they exclude
   games that the other filters would have included if left to their
   own devices.  For example, a "family filter" that excludes adult-themed
   games is only interested in removing games that match its adult-content
   test.
</p>
<p>
   A metafilter can also act as a "widening" filter, though.  A widening
   filter is one that selects some of the games that the other active
   filters would have rejected.  For example, if you wanted to make
   sure that a certain core set of games was always available in the
   wheel UI, no matter what filter was selected, you could do that with
   a widening filter.
</p>
<p>
   To create a filter that can widen the selection, you must set the
   <b>includeExcluded</b> property in the filter description to true
   when creating the filter.  This allows its <b>select</b> function
   to be called with every game in the collection, even games that
   were excluded by other active filters.  In the <b>select</b>
   function, you can tell whether or not a game was accepted by the
   other filters via the <i>included</i> argument.
</p>
<p>
   Here's an example
   that keeps the other current filters' decisions intact, but also
   adds games marked with the "Core" category tag, even if they
   were excluded by other filters.
</p>
<div class="code">
gameList.createMetaFilter({
    includeExcluded: true,   // consider all games, even if excluded by other filters
    priority: 100000,        // high priority so that get the last say
    select: function(game, included) {
        // keep it if it's included by the other filters, OR if
        // it has the "Core" category tag
        return included || game.categories.indexOf("Core") >= 0;
    }
});
