<h1>A "Top 10" Filter</h1>

<p>
   PinballY has lots of built-in filters for viewing subsets of
   your installed games.  One type is the Star Rating filters, which
   let you see games that you've rated 5 Stars, 4 Stars, etc.
</p>
<p>
   A poster on one of the virtual pinball forums suggested that
   it might be nice to have filters for broader ratings categories -
   say, "Good Games", which the poster proposed
   might be anything rated 3 Stars or better.
</p>
<p>
   Once you start thinking about complex filters like that, you
   can come up with all sorts of variations.  Not just in the
   nature of the filters, but in their details.  I might
   think of "good" as 3+ stars, but you might be
   a lot picker and think it means 4&frac12; or better.
   So this struck me as a great candidate for some Javascript
   custom filters, rather than something built into the system.
   By expressing this type of filter in Javascript, everyone
   can tune it to mean exactly what they think it should mean.
   Plus, it avoids the runaway menu bloat that would result
   if I started adding all of the ratings filters I can think of
   to PinballY itself; pretty soon there'd be so many filters
   that you'd never be able to find the one you're looking for.
</p>

<h2>3 Stars or Better</h2>
<p>
   Let's start with the original idea proposed on the forum: a
   filter that selects games rated 3 Stars or better.
</p>
<p>
   The basic way that all custom filters work is that you
   create a "filter function" in Javascript.  This is a
   function that you write, and which PinballY calls to
   ask if a game is "in" or "out" when the filter is
   selected.  PinballY passes the function a
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object, which
   is a Javascript object describing one entry in PinballY's
   master list of all of your virtual pinball tables.
   The GameInfo object provides you access to all of the
   information that PinballY has about the game, such
   as its name, release year, manufacturer, filename,
   system - and, of course, the star rating you've assigned
   to the game.
</p>
<p>
   This makes the filter function for "3 Stars or better"
   pretty easy to write.  All we have to do is check the
   rating value from the game object that PinballY passes
   us, and return true (for "yes, this game is in")
   if the rating is 3 or higher.  The rating is represented
   as a simple numeric value - 3 stars is simply the
   number 3.  Half stars are fractional values, so
   3&frac12; stars has the numeric value 3.5.  So the test
   is just an ordinary Javascript comparison:
</p>
<div class="code">
function ThreeStarsOrBetter(game)
{
    return game.rating >= 3;
}
</div>
<p>
   PinballY invokes a filter function once for each game
   in your collection whenever the user activates the filter.
   All you have to worry about in the filter function is
   the one game you're being asked about; PinballY takes
   care of iterating over the whole collection.
</p>

<p>
   How do you get PinballY to call your filter
   function in the first place, though?
   To do that, you have to call a system function,
   <a href="GameList.html#createFilter">gameList.createFilter()</a>.
   That tells PinballY about your filter function, and also
   gives it some other information that connects the filter
   function to a menu command that can be presented to the
   user.  The menu command lets the user activate the
   filter.
</p>
<p>
   See the <a href="GameList.html#createFilter">createFilter()</a>
   documentation for full details, but for simple filters,
   you only need to provide a few pieces of information:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>A unique "ID" for the filter.  This is just a
   string you make up, which PinballY uses to identify
   the filter when saving the user's settings.  If the
   user exits the program while this filter is selected,
   the ID will be saved in the settings as the active
   filter, so that PinballY can restore the same filter
   again at the start of the next session.

   <li>A title for the filter.  This is the name of the
   filter displayed in status line messages when the
   filter is selected.  It's also displayed by default
   in the menu where the filter is listed, although
   you can provide a separate menu title if you prefer.

   <li>A menu group name.  This defines a top-level menu
   command that PinballY automatically adds to the main
   "Play" menu.  Selecting that group menu will open a
   sub-menu showing all of the filters assigned to this
   same group.  Alternatively, you can specify one of
   the pre-defined system groups, which are all named
   with [Square Brackets] around their names.  For this
   example, we want to use the system "Filter by Ratings"
   menu group, named "[Rating]".

   <li>A "sort key".  This is optional, but highly
   useful for aesthetic purposes.  This tells PinballY
   where the filter's menu item goes in its menu, relative
   to the other filters in its menu group.  By default,
   the items are simply sorted alphabetically by title,
   but that's not the nicest way for a lot of cases.
   The sort key lets you specify a position more
   precisely.  In the case of the ratings filters,
   each "Star" item has a sort key equal to its
   star number - "1", "2", etc - except for the
   "Unrated" filter, which has sort key "Z" to make
   it sort at the end of the menu.  If you wanted
   to insert your Top Games filter after the "Star"
   items and before the "Unrated" item, you could
   use a sort key like "Y" (because it comes
   before "Z").
</ul>

<p>
   Here's how we create our 3-stars-or-better filter:
</p>

<div class="code">
gameList.createFilter({
    id: "Stars3Plus",
    title: "3+ Stars",
    menuTitle: "3+ Star Tables",
    group: "[Rating]",
    sortKey: "3+",
    select: function(game) { return game.rating >= 3; }
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that we've written the filter function the concise way,
   rather than writing it out as a named function as we did
   above.  We could just as well have used the named function,
   but this is a little neater because it keeps everything
   together where you can read it at a glance, without
   having to hunt around the file for the referenced
   function definition.
</p>
<p>
   Where do you put this code?  You just put it at the
   top level of a Javascript module, so that it runs when
   PinballY first reads the file.  You <i>could</i>
   paste it directly into your Scripts\Main.js file, but I
   think it's a little neater to break things up into separate
   files, where each file contains all of the code for just
   one feature.  So in this case, I'd put the code
   above into its own file in your Scripts folder: 
   call it ThreePlusRating.js, perhaps.  Then in your Main.js file,
   write this somewhere:
</p>
<div class="code">
import "ThreePlusRating.js";
</div>

<h2>Top N Games</h2>

<p>
   Instead of showing all of the games at a fixed rating
   or better, how about showing your Top 10 games?  Or Top 25,
   Top 100, etc?  I like this approach because
   it adapts to how you've assigned ratings.  If you've been
   in a particularly generous mood lately,  handing
   out 4-star ratings like candy, "3 stars or better" might
   encompass practically everything; or if you've been stingy
   with the high ratings, you might not have enough high-rated
   games to make "3 stars or better" a useful category.
</p>
<p>
   This is a somewhat more complicated filter, because we
   can't just rely on each individual game's rating, like
   we could in the first example.  In this case, everything's
   relative; we have to figure out where a game's rating
   puts it in the overall collection ranking.  That means
   that we have to look at where each game's ranking falls
   in the overall game list.
</p>
<p>
   How do we figure a game's place in the overall rankings?
   It's actually pretty easy.   Start by getting the full list
   of games via <a href="GameList.html#getAllGames">gameList.getAllGames()</a>.
   That'll give us an array containing <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   objects for every game.  We can then use Javascript array sorting
   to arrange these in order of star rating.  Since we want a "Top N"
   list, we'll sort from highest rating to lowest: that'll put the
   top-rated games at the start of the list.  We can then "slice"
   the array to get the first N elements.
</p>
<div class="code">
// get all of the games
let topGames = gameList.getAllGames();

// sort in descending order by rating
topGames.sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating);

// get the first (highest rated) N games
topGames = topGames.slice(0, n);
</div>

<p>
   That'll give us our "Top N" list.  To determine if a game is in the
   Top N, we just have to search the array to see if the game is there.
   We could do that the straightforward way by literally searching the
   array for every game, but if you know a little about algorithms, you
   know that's fairly inefficient.  It's much faster to use a special
   searching technique known as hashing.  Javascript has a built-in type
   called Map that does this.  We can convert our array to a map,
   keyed by the game ID, like this:
</p>

<div class="code">
topGames = new Map(topGames.map(g => [g.id, g]));
</div>

<p>
   We now have an efficient way to determine if a game is in the "Top N"
   list: it's in the list if its ID is in the map:
</p>

<div class="code">
select: function(game) { return topGames.get(game.id); }
</div>

<p>
   There's one more detail, which is: when exactly do we build that
   Top N map that we're going to search for each game?  We obviously
   don't want to do that in the select function itself: that would
   be extremely inefficient, since it would have to sort the entire
   game list and convert the array to a map over and over.  Javascript
   is fast, but repeating all of that work for every game in a large
   collection would add up to an unacceptable delay when selecting
   the filter.  We clearly want to do this work up front and save the
   results.  But at the same time, we can't just do it once at the
   start of the session and use the same results forever, because
   the list wouldn't adapt to new ratings you enter during the
   session.
</p>
<p>
   The solution is to use another filter feature that we haven't
   mentioned yet: the "before" function.  Remember that PinballY calls
   the "select" function once per game.  The "before" function is
   a companion function that's called once per filter invocation.
   That is, whenever the user selects a filter in the UI, PinballY
   first makes one call to the filter's "before" function, then calls
   the "select" function for each game.
</p>
<p>
   There's also an optional "after" function, which PinballY
   calls at the very end of the process.  This lets you do any
   final clean-up work after the filter is applied.
   In this case, we can use it to "forget" the map
   of games we create.  That isn't necessary, but it's good
   practice, because it frees up the memory used by an object
   we no longer need.
</p>
<p>
   Putting this all together, here's our "Top N" filter.
</p>
<div class="code">
function createTopFilter(n)
{
    let topGames;
    gameList.createFilter({
        id: "Top" + n,
        title: "Top " + n + " Rated",
        group: "[Rating]",
        sortKey: "9 Top " + n,  // sort after the 1-star, 2-star, etc items, before Unrated ("Z")

        // before each selection cycle, get the current Top N list
        before: function() {
            // get all of the games, sorted by descending rating, then slice to the top N
            let list = gameList.getAllGames().sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating).slice(0, n);

            // convert this to a Map (a hash lookup table), keyed by game ID
            topGames = new Map(list.map(g => [g.id, g]));
        },

        // filter for games in our current hash of the top N games
        select: function(game) {
            return topGames.get(game.id);
        },

        // after each cycle, free up the memory in the Top N map by
        // forgetting our reference to the map object
        after: function() {
            topGames = undefined;
        }
    });
}

// create a Top 10 filter
createTopFilter(10);

// create a Top 25 filter
createTopFilter(25);
</div>

<p>
   It should be obvious how to extend this to create whatever combination
   of "Top N" filters you'd like to include.
</p>

<h2>Top N with ties</h2>

<p>
   One small quibble with the Top N filter we created above is that
   it cuts off the list arbitrarily when there are ties.  For example,
   say you create a Top 10 filter, but your collection has 15 games
   with perfect 5-Star ratings.  The Top 10 filter we defined above is ruthless about
   picking 10 games.  So even though we have 15 games with the top rating,
   the filter above will still only select 10 games, so it'll select an
   arbitrary group of 10 out of our equally good 15.
</p>
<p>
   If this bothers you, one way to fix it would be to keep
   all of the games that have the same score as the 10th game in the list.
   Implementing this is a matter of adjusting
   the "slice" operation in the "before" function so that it extends the
   list to include any additional games that have the same star rating as the Nth game.
   So in our example with the 15 games with 5-star ratings, we'd look at the 10th
   slot in the list, see that it has a 5-star ratings, and then look to see
   how many additional games beyond the 10th have the same rating.  We'd
   then extend the "slice" cut-off point to the last 5-star game, so we'd
   end up with a list of 15 games.
</p>
<div class="code">
// get all of the games, sorted by descending rating
let list = gameList.getAllGames().sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating);

// include all games after the Nth game that are tied with the Nth game
let i = n;
while (i < list.length && list[i].rating == list[n-1].rating)
    ++i;

// slice and convert to a Map (a hash lookup table), keyed by game ID
topGames = new Map(list.slice(0, i).map(g => [g.id, g]));
</div>

<p>
   This is no longer technically a "Top 10" list,
   since it'll adapt to keep all of the games tied for the 10th
   position, but it's arguably a better approach than making an
   arbitrary cut.
</p>

<h2>Top N with additional criteria</h2>
<p>
   Another approach would be to stick to the strict "Top N", but
   come up with a better way to handle ties.  In particular,
   you could adopt a secondary sorting rule that decides
   which game is better when two games have the same rating.
   For example, you could give priority to the game
   with the higher play time or higher play count, on the
   theory that you probably like a game more if you spend more time
   playing it.  You can take that sort
   of thing into account in the sorting function:
</p>
<div class="code">
let list = gameList.getAllGames().sort((a, b) => {
    // sort by rating first, then by play time
    if (a.rating != b.rating)
        return b.rating - a.rating;
    else
        return b.playTime - a.playTime;
});
</div>
