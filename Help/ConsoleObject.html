<h1>console Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>console</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object that lets you
   display text messages on the debugger's console window when you're
   using a debugger (see <a href="JsDebug.html">Debugging</a>).  This
   provides a simple way of seeing what's going on in your code when
   troubleshooting scripts.  The PinballY console object is similar
   to the console object in a Web browser, with most of the same
   methods.
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   In the method descriptions below, "display" always means
   displaying on the debugger console.  If you're not currently
   using a debugger, there is no console, so any messages are
   simply discarded.  You can thus leave console logging messages in
   working code without bothering the user with extraneous messages.
   Even so, it's good practice to remove console messages when
   you're confident about a section of code and no longer need
   to instrument it: there's still some overhead in processing
   the method calls, and when you want to debug some other area
   of the code, you don't want to sift through the noise of
   leftover messages from unrelated areas.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.assert(<i>assertion</i>, <i>arguments...</i>):</b>
   If the <i>assertion</i> expression is false (or "falsey"), the
   function acts like console.log(), displaying the arguments the
   same way log() would.  Otherwise nothing is displayed.  This can
   be used to log messages when unexpected conditions occur.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.count(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays the number of times
   that this method has been called with the same label.  If the label
   is omitted, a default label based on the calling code location is used
   instead; this can be used to count the number of times a particular
   line of code is executed.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.countReset(<i>label</i>):</b> Resets the counter associated
   with the given label, for the purposes of console.count().
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.error(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's an error messages.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.exception(<i>arguments</i>):</b>  Identical to console.error().
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.format(<i>formatString</i>, <i>arguments</i>):</b>  Formats the
   printf-style "%" parameters in the format string, using the given arguments,
   and returns the resulting string.  This uses the same formatting codes
   described for console.log().  This lets you access the special formatting
   features directly for messages displayed in other places besides the
   console.
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>console.info(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's an informational message.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.log(<i>object</i>...)</b>:  Displays a message on the
   console log by converting each object to its string representation
   (using toString()), and appending the strings together, separated
   by spaces.  This is typically used to display simple string
   messages:
</p>

<div class="code">
console.log("This is a log messages!");
</div>

<p>
   <b>console.log(<i>formatString</i>, <i>arguments...</i>):</b>
   If the first argument to console.log() is a string, and it contains
   one or more "printf"-style "%" format codes, console.log() interprets
   it as a format string with substitution variables.  Each "%" code is
   replaced with a formatted version of the corresponding argument
   from the <i>arguments</i> list, in left-to-right order.  The format
   codes are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>%o</b> or <b>%O</b>: object format.  The corresponding
   argument is treated as an object and converted to a string with
   toString, then substituted for the %o or %O.

   <li><b>%d</b> or <b>%i</b>: decimal integer format.  The corresponding
   argument is formatted as an integer (any fractional part is
   discarded), in decimal radix (base 10).

   <li><b>%x</b> or <b>%X</b>: hex integer format.  The corresponding
   argument is formatted as an integer (any fractional part is
   discarded), in hexadecimal radix (base 16).  %x renders
   hex digits A-F in lower-case, while %X renders them in
   upper-case.

   <li><b>%f</b>: floating point format.  The argument is formatted
   as a floating point number value.

   <li><b>%s</b>: string.  The string value of the argument is
   substituted.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Flags, width, precision:</b>  You can include three optional
   elements before the specifier characters: flags, width, and
   precision.  These are specified like so:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <b>%</b> <i>flags</i> <i>width</i> <b>.</b> <i>precision</i> <i>specifier</i>
</div>

<p>Flags:</b>
<ul>
   <li><b>-</b>: left-justify the value in the available width
      meaning that any needed padding is added at the end of the
      numeric value.  E.g., "%-7d" formats 100 as "100"
      followed by four spaces.  The default is to right-justify,
      with extra spaces at the beginning of the number.

   <li><b>+</b>: for numeric types (%d, %i, %x, %X, %f), show a
      "+" sign if the value is positive.  E.g., <b>%+d</b> formats
      100 as "+100".

   <li><b><i>space</i></b>: for numeric types, insert a space at the
      beginning of the number if it's non-negative (so that positive and
      negative values use the same overall width).  E.g., "%&nbsp;d"
      formats 100 as "&nbsp;100" (note the leading space).

   <li><b>#</b>: for %x or %X format, add "0x" or "0X" (respectively)
      as a prefix to the displayed value, to match the way a hex number
      would appear in Javascript source code.  E.g., "%#x" formats
      100 as "0x64".

   <li><b>0</b>: for numeric types, if padding is required by the width
      specifier, use leading zeroes instead of spaces.  For example,
      "%05d" formats 100 as "00100".
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Width:</b>  
   This specifies the <i>minimum</i> width for the format.
   This works for all types except %o and %O, which ignore it.
   The width is given as an integer value, as in "%5d".
   If the formatted value is shorter than the minimum given
   by the width, padding is added, in the form of leading
   or trailing spaces.  For the numeric formats, the padding
   is added as leading zeroes ("0" characters) if the "0"
   flag is specified; for strings, padding is always spaces.
   The width is a minimum only, not a maximum; values that
   exceed the width aren't truncated.
</p>
<p>   
   For example, "%5d" formats 100 as "&nbsp;&nbsp;100" (with two leading spaces).
</p>

<p>
   <b>Precision:</b>
   This is a number specified after a "." in the format
   string: it's the "3" in "%.3f" or "%7.3f".
</p>
<p>
   For %f, the precision specifies the number of digits to
   show after the decimal point.  Values are rounded if
   necessary.  For example, "%.3f" displays 123.456789
   as "123.457".
</p>
<p>
   For integer formats, the precision simply has the effect
   of left-justifying the result instead of right-justifying it.
</p>
<p>
   For strings, the precision gives the maximum width.  If
   the string is longer, it's truncated.
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>console.time(<i>label</i>):</b>  Starts a timer under
   the given label.  This establishes the starting time for
   elapsed time measurements using console.timeLog() and console.timeEnd().
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.timeEnd(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays on the console
   the current elapsed time for the timer previously started under the
   given label with console.time(), and then removes the timer.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.timeLog(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays on the console
   the current elapsed time for the timer previously started under
   the given label with console.time().
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.trace()</b>: Displays a call stack trace for the calling code.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.warning(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's a warning message.
</p>
