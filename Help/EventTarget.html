<h1>EventTarget Interface</h1>

<p>
   The EventTarget interface is implemented by each object that
   generates Javascript events.  Here are the event targets and their
   associated events:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>
   <div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="mainWindow"></div>

   <li><a href="GameList.html">gameList</a>
   <div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="gameList"></div>
</ul>
<p>
   You call EventTarget methods by addressing the specific object
   that the events are associated with.  For example, to add a "keydown"
   event listener to the main playfield window, you'd write:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown", ev => { /* event handler code... */ });
</div>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.addEventListener(<i>event</i>, <i>listener</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>
   Adds an event listener.  <i>event</i> is a string giving the name of the event
   (e.g., "keydown").  <i>listener</i> is a function to call when this event occurs;
   the function takes a single parameter, an Event object that describes the event.
   <i>options</i> is an object with the following members:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>capture:</b> A boolean indicating whether the listener should be added to the
   "capture" stage or the "bubble" stage of processing for the event.  This isn't
   currently used, as no PinballY events distinguish these phases.

   <li><b>data:</b> Any value.  This will be passed to the event listener in
   <i>event.data</i> (the "data" property of the Event object parameter) each
   time this listener is invoked.  This can be used to store context information
   for the event listener.

   <li><b>once:</b>  A boolean.  If true, the listener is automatically removed
   (as though by calling removeEventListener()) the first time it's called.  Use
   this to create a listener that only handles the first event it receives.
</ul>
<p>
   The <i>options</i> parameter can be omitted, in which case default options
   are used.  For the sake of those familiar with the analogous Web browser
   method, <i>options</i> can also be passed as a boolean (true/false), in which
   case it specifies the value of the "capture" property.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.dispatchEvent(<i>event</i>):</b>
   Calls the registered event listeners for the given event.  The <i>event</i>
   argument is passed as the parameter to each listener invoked, with the
   event-specific properties (target, data) set appropriately for each call.
   Returns true if the event's default system processing should proceed,
   false if not.  Returning false usually means that <i>event</i>.preventDefault()
   was called in the course of processing the event.
</p>

<a name="off"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.off(<i>events</i>, <i>listener</i>):</b>
   Removes event listeners previously registered with on() or addEventListener().
   As with on(), <i>events</i> is a string listing one or more event names,
   separated by spaces.  And as with on(), namespaces can be specified in
   the event names with ".namespace" suffixes ("keydown.MyPlugin", for example).
   The <i>listener</i> argument is optional; if provided, only listeners
   originally added using the same function will be removed, otherwise all
   listeners matching the event name and namespace values will be removed.
</p>
<p>
   When namespaces are specified, <i>any</i> namespace match from the original
   on() call will match.  You don't have to match the whole list specified in on().  For example,
   if an event listener was registered as <b>target.on("keydown.MyPlugin.Main", func)</b>,
   <i>any</i> of these calls will remove it:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>target.off("keydown.MyPlugin")
   <li>target.off("keydown.Main")
   <li>target.off("keydown.MyPlugin.Main")
   <li>target.off("keydown.Main.MyPlugin")
</ul>

<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.on(<i>events</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>listener</i>):</b>
   Adds an event listener.  <i>events</i> is a string listing one or more
   events, separated by spaces (for example, "keydown keyup").  <i>data</i>
   is optional; if provided, it can be any type of value, and specifies a
   value that will be passed to the listener each time it's invoked in the
   "data" property of the event object, which is passed to the listener
   as its single function parameter.  <i>listener</i> is a function to call
   each time the event fires.
</p>
<p>
   The event name list can include "namespace" qualifiers for the events.
   A namespace is any arbitrary string appended after a "." to an event
   name, as in "keydown.MyPlugin".  You can specify multiple namespaces
   on a single event this way: "keydown.MyPlugin.Main".  The purpose of
   a namespace is to help identify the event in calls to off().  That
   method lets you specify namespaces the same way in the event(s) to be
   removed.  Namespaces are especially useful to create shared code
   modules that can be mixed and matched with other modules, since it
   makes it easier to manage your own module's listeners without
   affecting code from other unrelated modules.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.one(<i>events</i>, <i>data</i>, <i>listener</i>):</b>
   This works exactly like on(), but registers a one-time-only listener that
   will be removed the first time it fires.  If this registers listeners for
   multiple events, each event's listener will be set up as a separate
   once-only handler.  For example, if <i>events</i> is "keydown keyup", two
   listeners are registered, and each listener will be called once before
   it's removed.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>eventTarget</i>.removeEventListener(<i>type</i>, <i>listener</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>
   Removes an event listener that matches the type, function, and capture setting
   used in a prior call to addEventListener() or on().  As in the Web browser analog
   of this method, the only <i>options</i> value used to match the listener
   is the "capture" property.  
</p>
