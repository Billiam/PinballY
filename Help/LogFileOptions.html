<h1>Log File Options</h1>

<p>
   PinballY writes some internal technical information to a "log file" while
   running.  This is a simple human-readable text file that you can review
   to see the additional technical detail.  This is mostly intended for
   troubleshooting purposes, to provide more transparency on the inner
   workings of the program when something goes wrong.  PinballY tries to
   keep the graphical part of the UI friendly and non-technical, but that
   has the tradeoff that it hides a lot of information about what's
   going on inside the program.  The log file is meant to help fill in
   the missing pieces when necessary.
</p>
<p>
   The dialog shows the location and name of the log file, in case you want
   to inspect its contents.  You can simply click on the link to open the
   file in Notepad.
</p>

<h2>Enabling individual features</h2>

<p>
   You can select the type of information included in the log file.  The
   default settings exclude most items, to keep the log file as small as
   possible.  Writing more information to the file slows down the program
   a little and obviously uses more disk space, plus it's harder to
   find the information you're looking for if you have to sift through
   tons of unrelated information.  So the program lets you turn individual
   logging features on and off.  When things are working well, you can turn
   everything off to minimize overhead and disk space, but if you're having
   a problem with a particular area, you can enable logging for that feature.

<p>
   <b>Player system setup:</b>  Information on setting up the configured
   pinball player systems, and for the process of searching for their
   table files and table databases.  This gives you detailed
   information about how the system is interpreting the settings
   information for each system, such as all of the folder paths
   involved, and shows where it's looking for table files and
   table information databases.  This can be helpful if PinballY
   isn't finding all of your tables or isn't finding bibliographic
   information that you've previously entered (titles, manufacturers,
   years, etc).  It can also help figure out the problem if
   you can't launch (play) any of a system's tables successfully.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Real DMD:</b>  Information about detecting and setting up
   your real DMD device, if any.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Media file searches:</b>  Enables logging for media file searches,
   showing where PinballY is looking for media files to display when
   games are selected in the "wheel".  This can help track down why
   images or videos aren't showing up in the UI when they should be.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Media capture:</b> Logs information when capturing screen
   shots and videos for your games.  This lets you see any error
   messages from FFMPEG.  This can be helpful if the capture
   process is producing empty files or blank images.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Table launch:</b>  Logs details when trying to launch
   a table with a player system.  This can be helpful if a
   particular game won't launch correctly.  (If none of the
   tables for a particular system will launch correctly, you
   might also try enabling "player system setup" logging
   above to see how the system is being configured overall.)
