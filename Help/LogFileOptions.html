<h1>Log File Options</h1>

<p>
   PinballY writes some internal technical information to a "log file" while
   running.  This is a simple human-readable text file that you can review
   to see the additional technical detail.  This is mostly intended for
   troubleshooting purposes, to provide more transparency on the inner
   workings of the program when something goes wrong.  PinballY tries to
   keep the graphical part of the UI friendly and non-technical, but that
   has the tradeoff that it hides a lot of information about what's
   going on inside the program.  The log file is meant to help uncover
   some of that hidden internal detail when necessary, without bothering
   you with it when it's not.
</p>
<p>
   The dialog shows the location and name of the log file, in case you want
   to inspect its contents.  Click on the filename link to open the
   file in Notepad.
</p>
<p>
   Note that PinballY erases any old contents of the log file each time
   it start up, so that the file doesn't grow to enormous proportions
   over time.  If you want to save the log output from a particular program
   session for later review, be sure to move or rename the file before you
   run PinballY again, so that the new session doesn't erase the
   old copy that you wanted to save.  The program always writes the log
   using the same file name, so all you have to do to save a particular
   copy is rename it or move it to a different folder.
</p>
   

<h2>Enabling individual features</h2>

<p>
   You can select the type of information included in the log file.  The
   default settings exclude most items, to reduce the size of the file.
   Writing more information to the file slows down the program
   a little and obviously uses more disk space, plus it's harder to
   find the information you're looking for if you have to sift through
   tons of unrelated information.  So the program lets you turn individual
   logging features on and off.  When things are working well, you can turn
   everything off to minimize overhead and disk space, but if you're having
   a problem with a particular area, you can enable logging for that feature.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Player system setup:</b>  Information on setting up the configured
   pinball player systems, and for the process of searching for their
   table files and table databases.  This gives you detailed
   information about how the system is interpreting the settings
   information for each system, such as all of the folder paths
   involved, and shows where it's looking for table files and
   table information databases.  This can be helpful if PinballY
   isn't finding all of your tables or isn't finding bibliographic
   information that you've previously entered (titles, manufacturers,
   years, etc).  It can also help figure out the problem if
   you can't launch (play) any of a system's tables successfully.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Real DMD:</b>  Information about detecting and setting up
   your real DMD device, if any.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Media file searches:</b>  Enables logging for media file searches,
   showing where PinballY is looking for media files to display when
   games are selected in the "wheel".  This can help track down why
   images or videos aren't showing up in the UI when they should be.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Media capture:</b> Logs information when capturing screen
   shots and videos for your games.  This lets you see any error
   messages from FFMPEG.  This can be helpful if the capture
   process is producing empty files or blank images.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Table launch:</b>  Logs details when trying to launch
   a table with a player system.  This can be helpful if a
   particular game won't launch correctly.  (If none of the
   tables for a particular system will launch correctly, you
   might also try enabling "player system setup" logging
   above to see how the system is being configured overall.)
</p>

<p>
   <b>DirectOutput (DOF):</b>  DOF is a separate program that
   provides the software interface to hardware feedback devices
   in your cabinet (lights, solenoids, shaker motors, etc).
   If you have any of these devices, you probably already have
   DOF installed, since it's needed to use the devices with
   Visual Pinball and some other programs.  PinballY will
   automatically detect if DOF is installed and use it if so.
   Enable this logging option to include information in the
   PinballY log file about PinballY's attempts to detect and
   access DOF.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this option doesn't affect the separate logging DOF
   does on its own.  DOF normally writes its own log file,
   DirectOutput.log, usually to the same folder where the
   application is running (so in this case, to the PinballY
   folder).  If PinballY's log shows that PinballY is successfully
   detecting and loading DOF, but your feedback devices don't seem
   to be working properly within PinballY, you might need to look
   at DirectOutput.log to see if DOF is encountering any errors.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Javascript:</b>  Enable this to log information about
   Javascript.  PinballY looks for a user Javascript script file
   at startup, and if present, it loads and executes the file.
   This logging option includes details in the log about the
   script search and loading process, which can be helpful if
   scripts aren't loading as expected.
