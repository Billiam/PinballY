<h1>Editing a Game's Details</h1>

<p>
   PinballY keeps track of some extra information for each game
   in your collection.  This includes descriptive information
   about the game (title, manufacturer, year of release), plus
   internal information that PinballY uses to customize how
   the game is displayed and launched.
</p>
<p>
   You can edit most of these details directly through the
   main PinballY wheel user interface:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Bring up the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>
   <li>Select <a href="GameSetupMenu.html">Game Setup</a>
   <li>Select Edit Game Details
</ul>

<p>
   That will display the Game Details dialog:
</p>
<img src="EditGameDetails.png" class="example">

<h2>Setting up a new game</h2>
<p>
   If a game hasn't been configured yet, the main menu will
   include the Game Setup command when the game is selected
   in the wheel.  You can use this command to reach the
   Game Setup menu, where you can select Edit Game Details
   to bring up the Game Details dialog.
</p>
<p>
   When you first open this dialog for a game that hasn't
   been configured yet, most of the fields will be blank.  The
   only ones that are normally pre-filled are the Title, which will
   contain the file name of the table file, and possibly the
   System, which PinballY can usually guess from the folder
   path where the game file was found.  In cases where you've
   set up two or more systems that share the same table folder,
   though, the system will be ambiguous, so PinballY won't be
   able to guess and will leave the System field blank.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Filling in the form from IPDB data:</b>
   Take a close look at the Title field, and you'll notice that
   there's a little drop-list arrow next to it.  Click the arrow
   to bring up a list of possible matches from 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipdb.org/">IPDB</a>.
   PinballY has a built-in list of titles from IPDB that it
   tries to match to the filename.
</p>
<p>
   Matching the filename to a real machine's title requires a bit of
   guesswork on PinballY's part, since table file names tend
   to be a bit cryptic.  They often use initials or abbreviations,
   and usually have a bunch of other information apart from the
   title packed into them, such as the author's nickname,
   table version numbers, system version numbers, etc.  The list
   that pops up usually has five or ten possible matches, and of
   course only one of these can be right (if the right match is
   there at all).  That's why PinballY doesn't just pick one on
   its own: it needs your human intervention to make the final
   decision.
</p>
<p>
   If the drop list contains the correct match for the game
   you're setting up, simply choose that title from the list, and
   the program will automatically use it to fill in not just the
   title but also the other information available from IPDB:
   the IPPD game number, manufacturer, year, and table type.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Filling in the details manually:</b>  If you can't find
   the right match for the game in the title drop list, or if
   there's anything you disagree with in the pre-populated
   data, you can simply type values into any of the fields
   manually.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Choosing the system:</b>  If the System box isn't already
   filled in, you'll have to specify the system manually.  The
   program figures out which system or systems are associated
   with the table folder where the file is located; if there's
   only one system using that table folder, the program automatically
   selects that system, since that's the only one it could be.
   But if you've set things up so that there are two or more
   systems sharing the same table folder, PinballY can't guess
   at the system based on the file path alone.  In that case,
   you'll have to specify the system manually.  Simply use
   the drop list to select the system that you want to be
   used when the game is launched.
</p>


<h2>Editing an existing game</h2>
<p>
   After a game has been set up the first time, PinballY removes
   the Game Setup command from the main menu.  Most
   people don't want to see a bunch of administrative options
   on the main menu during normal play; once a game has
   been set up, it's considered to be ready for normal play.
   But Game Setup is always available through the
   <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Navigate to the game in the wheel
   <li>Bring up the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>
   <li>Select <a href="GameSetupMenu.html">Game Setup</a>
   <li>Select Edit Game Details
</ul>
   

<h2>Details on the fields</h2>

<p>
   <b>Title:</b>  The title of the game.  PinballY uses this to
   display the game's name in the wheel UI.  This also serves as
   part of the "key" that identifies the game in the XML database
   (the title is combined with the manufacturer name and year to
   form the full ID).
</p>
<p>
   <b>IPDB ID:</b>  If the game is a re-creation of a real table
   that has an entry on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipdb.org/">IPDB</a>,
   you can fill this in with the game's ID on IPDB.  The ID is a number
   that IPDB uses as its database key to identify the game.  
   If you look up the game on IPDB through a search, you'll find
   the ID number listed right at the top of the listing:
</p>
<img src="ipdbId.jpg" class="example">

<p>
   PinballY doesn't currently do much with the IPDB ID other than
   storing it, but I think it's a good piece of information to
   have on hand, if only for future reference.  It would
   make a particularly good key for correlating information from
   external sources, since it's so specific and unambiguous.

<p>
   <b>Manufacturer:</b>  The name of the company that built and
   marketed the original pinball machine, such as Williams or Gottlieb.
   For a purely virtual table (one that never existed as a physical arcade
   pinball machine), you could enter the software publisher or author's name here.
</p>
<p>
   I prefer to use the informal marketing name of the manufacturer here
   (e.g., "Williams") rather than the full legal name of the company
   ("Williams Electronic Games, Inc."), which you'll find if you look
   games on IPDB.  PinballY uses the name you
   enter here for a number of purposes, such as selecting which logo
   file to use, so it's easier to shorten those long legal names down
   to the more familiar marketing names.  If you let PinballY auto-populate
   this field based on the title, it'll use the short name.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Release year:</b>  The year of release of the original real
   pinball machine, or, for a purely virtual game, the year the software
   was first published.  Use a full four-digit year number here (e.g., 1995,
   not 95).
</p>

<p>
   <b>System:</b>  The game player system that PinballY should use to
   launch the game.  The drop list will only allow you to choose systems
   that are associated with the table folder where the file is located.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Table type:</b>  The IPDB 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipdb.org/showhelp.pl?item=type">table type</a>
   classification:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>ME (pure mechanical), for very old games without any electronic scoring system
   <li>EM (electromechanical), for games from about the 1950s through 1970s that worked
   like old mechanical adding machines, with score reels or individual scoring lights
   <li>SS (solid state), for games from the late 1970s onwards that use microprocessors
   to control the game and display scores with digital displays (segmented or dot matrix)
</ul>

<p>
   <b>High score display:</b>  The style to use for the synthesized high score
   displays that PinballY shows in the DMD window.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Auto: PinballY chooses the appropriate style based on the machine's release year
   and table type
   <li>DMD: Dot-matrix style, like machines in the 1990s and later
   <li>Alpha: 16-segment alphanumeric style, like machines in the 1980s
   <li>TT: Typewriter style, meant to resemble the sort of hand-made
   sticky notes that you might have used to record high scores on old
   EM games that didn't keep track of high scores themselves
   <li>None: Suppress the automatic DMD window high score display for this game entirely.
   (This doesn't prevent you from viewing the high scores with the High Score command
   in the main menu; it just prevents PinballY from showing its synthesized high score
   display in the DMD window.)
</ul>

<p>
   <b>ROM name:</b>  The name of the ROM for this game.  This is only applicable
   to games that use VPinMAME, and Visual Pinball is currently the only system
   that uses VPinMAME, so you can leave this blank for games based on other systems.
   PinballY uses this information when fetching high scores from ROM-based games,
   and to inform DOF which game is loaded on the wheel (to select game-dependent
   DOF effects, such as flipper button colors and undercab lighting colors).
   "Default" lets PinballY pick the ROM automatically based on the list of
   tables in the DOF configuration.  You can select a specific ROM if the
   automatic selection is wrong.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Date added:</b>  The date that you added the game to your system, in
   MM/DD/YYYY format (month/day/year).  This is automatically populated with
   today's date the first time you set up a game, but you can set a different
   date if you actually installed the game earlier and are just now setting
   it up in PinballY.  This is used primarily for the sake of the "Date Added"
   filters, to let you select games that were added within or outside of
   a certain time horizon.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Grid Row x Col:</b>  The coordinates of the game in the "grid" for
   the game system's game selection UI.  Enter this as <i>row</i> x <i>col</i>,
   as in 3x4 for row 3, column 4.
</p>
<p>
   This is only displayed if the
   selected system uses the grid position somewhere in its startup keys
   script (see <a href="SystemOptions.html#startupKeys">Startup Keys</a>
   in System Options).
</p>
<p>
   The grid position is an idiosyncratic feature
   designed mostly for Farsight's
   <i>The Pinball Arcade</i>, which doesn't provide a way to launch a
   game directly from an outside program, but always requires you to
   go through its own internal game selection menu every time it starts.
   PinballY lets you define a series of keystrokes (the Startup Keys
   setting mentioned above) to send to the game system just after
   launching to try to navigate to the right game.  Since Farsight
   arranges their game selection UI as a rectangular grid, the key
   script had to know how many "down" and "right" arrow keys to
   send to get to any given game; that's what the grid position
   entry is for.
</p>

<p>
   <b>"Keep the following windows open...":</b>  These checkboxes
   let you tell PinballY to continue showing one or more of the
   PinballY windows while the playing this game.  The
   selected windows will remain in the foreground and will continue
   to show their background graphics or videos throughout the game.
</p>
<p>
   Normally, PinballY blanks all of its windows while a game is running,
   and allows the running game to place its windows in front of the
   PinballY windows (to the extent they're situated in the same
   display area).  The assumption is that you want the game to take
   over the entire display while it's running, and that you don't
   want PinballY wasting CPU time and video memory by continuing to
   play back videos in windows that are covered up by the running game.
</p>
<p>
   However, some game systems and some individual games only use a
   portion of the display.  For example, few systems display anything
   at all in the "Topper" monitor (if you have one).  Some games don't
   even include any backglass or DMD graphics.  In these cases, you
   might prefer to let PinballY keep showing its graphics in the
   display areas that the game system doesn't use, so that there's
   something more interesting in those areas than blank black
   backgrounds.  Simply check the box for each window that you want
   PinballY to keep open while the game is running.  PinballY will
   continue to show the game's video or background image in that
   window during play.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY also forces each selected window into the "topmost"
   window layer during game execution, in an attempt to keep the
   PinballY window in front of any window the game displays
   in the same area.  This lets you not just use the PinballY
   windows to fill in for missing graphics, but also to replace
   any graphics the game would normally display that you don't
   like.  For example, some systems make a half-hearted attempt
   at backglass graphics by displaying a static image with
   no animation.  You might prefer to show the PinballY backglass
   video throughout play instead in such cases.  The automatic
   "topmost" layering helps ensure that the PinballY window
   will appear in front of the game system's window, effectively
   replacing it on the screen.  (This isn't absolutely guaranteed
   to keep the PinballY window in front, because the game could
   also lay claim to the "topmost" layer, in which case it will
   usually have precedence because it's the foreground application.
   You might need to resort to tweaking the game's settings in
   such a case to tell the game not to show the unwanted window.)

<h2>Where are the details stored on my disk?</h2>

<p>
   The details for a game are split between two files:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The basic descriptive items (title, manufacturer, release
   year) are stored in the XML database file where the game's
   entry is stored.  The exact file name and location of a particular
   game's XML entry depends upon which system the game is
   associated with.  See <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#tableDatabases">Table Database</a>
   for details on how these files are arranged.

   <li>Other items are stored in PinballY's "game statistics"
   database file, GameStats.csv, which you can find in the main
   PinballY install folder.  See <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#gameStatsCsv">Table Statistics</a>
   for details.
</ul>
