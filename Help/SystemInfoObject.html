<h1>systemInfo Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>systemInfo</b> is a pre-defined object that provides information about
   the PinballY program.  You can access it by referring to properties
   of the global systemInfo object:
</p>
<div class="code">
message("The PinballY version number is " + systemInfo.version.display);
</div>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   <b>platform:</b> Processor architecture of the current session.  This is "x86"
   on 32-bit Windows, or "x64" on 64-bit Windows.
</p>
<p>
   "x86" and "x64" also imply that the CPU is based on the Intel architecture.
   This doesn't necessarily mean that the CPU was actually manufactured by Intel,
   only that it uses a compatible instruction set.  It could equally well be an
   AMD chip, since AMD makes CPUs with the same architecture.  What "x86" and "x64"
   do tell you for sure is that the program <i>isn't</i> running on an ARM CPU,
   which is a different architecture used in some Windows tablets.  PinballY
   doesn't currently run on ARM versions of Windows, so you won't currently
   see any values besides x86 and x64 for this property.  However, it's always
   good to keep open the possibility that new platforms could come into the
   picture in the future, so if possible you shouldn't assume that these
   are the only two possible cases.
</p>

<p>
   <b>programName:</b> A string containing the name of the program ("PinballY").
</p>

<p>
   <b>version:</b>  An object with information on the program version.  The object
   has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>basic:</b>  The basic three-part program version string (e.g., "1.0.0")

  <li><b>build:</b>  An integer giving the build number (an arbitrary serial number
  that increases on each build, mostly to help identify precise release versions when
  troubleshooting)

  <li><b>buildDate:</b>  A Date object representing the build date of the running version

  <li><b>display:</b>  The program version string, in a format suitable for display,
  capturing the basic three-part version, build number, and release status information

  <li><b>semantic:</b>  The <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> representation of the program version

  <li><b>status:</b>  Release status: "Dev", "Alpha", "Beta", "RC" (release candidate), or "Release"
</ul>
