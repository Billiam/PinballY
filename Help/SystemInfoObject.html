<h1>systemInfo Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>systemInfo</b> is a pre-defined object that provides information about
   the PinballY program.  You can access it by referring to properties
   of the global systemInfo object:
</p>
<div class="code">
message("The PinballY version number is " + systemInfo.version.display);
</div>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   <b>platform:</b> Processor architecture of the current session.  This is
   one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"x86" for 32-bit Windows on a CPU using the Intel x86 instruction set
   <li>"x64" for 64-bit Windows on a CPU using the Intel x64 instruction set
</ul>

<p>
   To future-proof your code, you shouldn't assume that those are the only
   possible values, since other platforms could be added in the future.
   For example, Windows itself runs on ARM CPUs in addition to Intel x86
   and x64 platforms, so PinballY could potentially be ported to the ARM
   version of Windows at some point.  Likewise, Windows could add support
   in the future for new processors that don't even exist yet.
</p>

<p>
   <b>programDir:</b> A string containing the full Windows file system path
   to the PinballY install folder.
</p>
<p>
   <b>programExe:</b> A string containing the full Windows file system path
   to the PinballY program (.EXE) file.
</p>

<p>
   <b>programName:</b> A string containing the name of the program ("PinballY").
</p>

<p>
   <b>version:</b>  An object with information on the program version.  The object
   has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>basic:</b>  The basic three-part program version string (e.g., "1.0.0")

  <li><b>build:</b>  An integer giving the build number (an arbitrary serial number
  that increases on each build, mostly to help identify precise release versions when
  troubleshooting)

  <li><b>buildDate:</b>  A Date object representing the build date of the running version

  <li><b>display:</b>  The program version string, in a format suitable for display,
  capturing the basic three-part version, build number, and release status information

  <li><b>semantic:</b>  The <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> representation of the program version

  <li><b>status:</b>  Release status: "Dev", "Alpha", "Beta", "RC" (release candidate), or "Release"
</ul>
