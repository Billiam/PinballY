<h1>systemInfo Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>systemInfo</b> is a pre-defined object that provides information about
   the PinballY program.  You can access it by referring to properties
   of the global systemInfo object:
</p>
<div class="code">
message("The PinballY version number is " + systemInfo.version.display);
</div>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   <b>platform:</b> Processor architecture of the current session.  This is
   one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"x86" for 32-bit Windows on a CPU using the Intel x86 instruction set
   <li>"x64" for 64-bit Windows on a CPU using the Intel x64 instruction set
</ul>

<p>
   As of this writing, Windows itself also is capable of running on ARM
   CPUs, which are used in some Windows tablet computers.  PinballY doesn't
   currently support the ARM versions of Windows, though, so you'll currently
   only see the two Intel variants listed above.  However, to future-proof
   your code, it's best not to assume that those are the only values
   possible.  An ARM version of PinballY could come along at some point,
   for example, plus it's entirely possible that Windows will one day
   run on new CPU architectures that don't exist yet.
</p>

<p>
   <b>programName:</b> A string containing the name of the program ("PinballY").
</p>

<p>
   <b>version:</b>  An object with information on the program version.  The object
   has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>basic:</b>  The basic three-part program version string (e.g., "1.0.0")

  <li><b>build:</b>  An integer giving the build number (an arbitrary serial number
  that increases on each build, mostly to help identify precise release versions when
  troubleshooting)

  <li><b>buildDate:</b>  A Date object representing the build date of the running version

  <li><b>display:</b>  The program version string, in a format suitable for display,
  capturing the basic three-part version, build number, and release status information

  <li><b>semantic:</b>  The <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> representation of the program version

  <li><b>status:</b>  Release status: "Dev", "Alpha", "Beta", "RC" (release candidate), or "Release"
</ul>
