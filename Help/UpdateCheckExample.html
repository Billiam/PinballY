<h1>Check for PinballY Updates</h1>

<p>
   Javascript is known first and foremost as the programming language
   of Web applications and browsers, so it's reasonable to think of
   ways we could use it in PinballY to access Internet servers.
   As a simple example, let's see how we could contact the Web
   server where PinballY downloads are hosted and find out if a new
   update is available.
</p>

<h2>HttpRequest</h2>
   The way you access Web data from PinballY's Javascript is similar
   to the way you do it in a regular Web browser, but not exactly
   the same.  The PinballY way is actually a little easier and
   cleaner than the browser way, since the browser way was invented
   in the very earliest days of Javascript, before some better
   and more modern Javascript conventions were developed.  In
   browsers, you use an object called XMLHttpRequest.  In PinballY,
   you use a very similar object called HttpRequest.  We changed
   the name in part because the "XML" part in the browser version was
   always a bit of misnomer, and in part as a reminder that our
   version doesn't have exactly the same semantics as the browser version.
</p>
<p>
   We have a  <a href="HttpRequest.html">whole separate chapter</a>,
   on the HttpRequest object, so we won't reiterate all of that here.
   We'll just show how to use it as we develop the example.
</p>

<h2>The PinballY version history page</h2>
<p>
   Web applications that send HTTP requests usually access "services"
   on the Web, which are basically Web pages that contain some kind
   of structured program data, rather than human-readable text and
   photos of cats.  If we were developing a full Web Service example
   here, we'd have to create a server program to go with our PinballY
   code.  But that's beyond the scope; we don't want to get into
   writing server-side Python or php or any of that.  Instead, we're
   going to keep it simple by accessing a regular text page on
   the PinballY Web site, and doing some simple searching through
   the page to find the version information we're looking for.
</p>
<p>
   In particular, we're going to make our Javascript code download
   the PinballY "version history" file.  This is a file that you
   might have come across in the PinballY install folder.  It's
   a plain text file that I use to keep notes about all of the changes
   made in each release of PinballY - new features added, bugs fixed,
   etc.  That file isn't only in the install folder, though; it's
   also on the PinballY Web site.  The one in your install folder
   is obviously the one that goes with the version you currently
   have installed, whereas the one on the Web site is always
   the latest release.  So if we can grab the one on the Web site
   and somehow scan it for the latest release date, we can find
   out if there's a more recent version available on the Web
   site than the one you currently have installed.
</p>
<p>
   It turns out that it's pretty easy to perform that scan, because
   the file uses a consistent format to list each release's date
   and version number.  So we can use a simple regular expression
   search to find the latest release date.
   You can open up the local version info file yourself and look
   at the format - it's called VersionHistory.txt, and you should
   find it in your main PinballY install folder.  But to save you
   the trouble, I'll give you a quick summary of how the versions
   are listed.  The latest version is always listed first, and
   every version's list of changes is preceded by a line giving
   the release date and version number, in this format:
</p>
<p style="font-family: Courier New, typewriter; padding-left: 1em;">
   05-31-2020 (1.0.0 Beta 24)
</p>
<p>
   So all we need to do is scan the file for lines that
   match that format, which is easy using Javascript regular
   expressions.  Since the releases are always arranged in
   the file from the newest to oldest, all we have to do is find
   the first line matching that format.  And then to find out if this is
   newer than the version that you've got installed locally, we
   can consult the <a href="SystemInfoObject.html">System Information object</a>,
   which PinballY provides to Javascript to let it find out things
   like what kind of computer we're running on and what version
   of PinballY is running.
</p>

<h2>The code</h2>

<p>
   Here's the Javascript code to carry out the version check.  We'll
   do this at the "top level" of the script, so that it simply runs
   when the script first loads at PinballY startup.
   That will make the version check happen automatically every time
   you run the program.
</p>
<p>
   HTTP requests are carried out asynchronously, so the time it takes
   for the PinballY Web site to send the file won't affect your
   program startup time.  The Web transaction will simply proceed in
   the background until the page is returned from the server.  Once
   it's returned, the "then" handler will be called, and it'll parse
   the file and check the new release date.  If there is in fact a
   new version available, the script will add a message about it
   to the status line.
</p>

    // and version string.  These are formatted as MM-DD-YYYY (x.y.z...)

    // be the newest.

    // through data with embedded newlines ("m" is for "multi-line mode").
    // One important thing that "m" mode does is to make the regular
    // expression parser think of "^" as the start of a line rather than
    // as the start of the whole string.

        // convert them into a Javascript Date value.  Note that the
        // Javascript date constructor uses 0 to represent January,
        // so we have to adjust the "mm" part accordingly.  Treat
        // the date in the file as UTC to avoid any dependency on the
        // local machine's time zone.
        //
        // We use the date rather than the version string as the basis
        // for our comparison, just because it's easier.  Comparing
        // version strings correctly is rather tricky because of the
        // complex internal structure, with the dots and the "beta"
        // suffixes and so on.  It's not impossible, just not worth
        // the hassle, given that we have the dates to work with

        // prefer a one-time message that requires acknowledgment,
        // but I prefer a less obtrusive approach for this sort of
        // notification.  The existence of an update doesn't demand
        // any immediate action, so I don't think it merits an
        // interruption to the UI flow by requiring the user to
        // acknowledge the message.
        //
        // Note that an added status line message like this will only
        // last until the next settings reload, so the message will
        // disappear after the user edits the options, plays a game,
        // or does anything else that triggers a settings reload.
        // If you want to make the message "stick", you could add
        // a listener for the "settingsreload" event (see Events >
        // EventTypes > SettingsEvent in the help), and stuff the
        // message back into the status line at that point.
