<h1>HWND Objects</h1>

<p>
   The HWND class represents a native window handle, which is the type
   used in the Windows APIs to refer to an on-screen window.  This is
   a subtype of the <a href="HandleObject.html">HANDLE</a> object, which
   represents any sort of system handle value.
</p>
<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   You don't typically create HWND objects directly.  You usually get
   them from system objects (such as <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>)
   or from external DLL functions.
</p>
<p>
   If necessary, though, you can explicitly create an HWND object via <b>new HWND(<i>value</i>)</b>,
   where <i>value</i> is a string, number, or <a href="Int64.html">Uint64</a> value
   containing a numeric representation of a window handle value, or another
   HWND or <a href="HandleObject.html">HANDLE</a> object.  This allows you
   to coerce a generic object handle to the window handle type, or to
   create a window handle object from a value you obtained externally.
</p>
<p>
   Note that new HWND() doesn't actually create an on-screen window, and it
   doesn't magically convert any arbitrary number you give it into a valid
   window handle.  The number or handle you supply must <i>already</i> be
   a valid window handle.  If you supply a value that isn't a valid window
   handle, the various window information methods will return nonsensical
   results.
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   HWND is a subtype of HANDLE, so it has all of the prototype methods of
   the regular HANDLE object.  It has the following additional methods that
   are specific to windows.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>hwnd</i>.getWindowPos():</b>  Returns an object with information
   on the position of the window represented by the handle.  The returned
   object has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>clientRect: a rectangle object with the coordinates
   of the client area of the window.  The client area is the interior
   of the window, excluding any border, caption, or framing that the
   system draws around the window's perimeter.  The client rectangle
   is always in relative coordinates, relative to its own upper left
   corner, so the "left" and "top" coordinates are always zero.

   <li>isMaximized: true if the window is currently maximized, false
   if not.  Note that this returns false for full-screen windows,
   because full-screen mode and maximized are distinct modes with
   different display styles.  A maximized window takes over the 
   <i>work area</i> area of its monitor, which excludes the system
   task bar, and it still displays its standard Windows caption bar
   controls.  A full-screen window, in contrast, hides all of its
   frame controls, and it takes over the full physical <i>display
   area</i> of its monitor, including space normally taken by the
   task bar.

   <li>isMinimized: true if the window is currently minimized, false
   if not.  A minimized window is only visible as an icon on the
   task bar.

   <li>windowRect: a rectangle object with the coordinates of
   the outer area of the window, including any system borders, caption,
   and framing.  The rectangle is expressed in screen coordinates,
   relative to the top left corner of the desktop area.  Note that
   it's possible for the coordinates to be negative on a multi-monitor
   system, because the zero position is the top left of your primary
   monitor.  If you've arranged another monitor on the virtual desktop
   (using the Windows display control panel) so that it's above or
   to the left of the primary monitor's area, that monitor's area
   will have negative coordinates.
</ul>
<p>
   The rectangle elements are represented as objects, with properties
   left, top, right, bottom giving the bounding coordinates as integer
   values.  The bottom right corner is expressed
   as the position of the first pixel just <i>outside</i> of the window
   to the right and below.  This might seem a little awkward, but all
   Windows APIs use the same convention, so it ensures consistency with any
   window measurements you obtain from direct calls to Windows APIs
   or other sources.  It also has the useful property that (right - left)
   yields the rectangle's width and (bottom - top) yields its height.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>hwnd</i>.isVisible():</b>  Returns true if the window is currently
   visible, false if not.  Visibility is a system attribute that determines
   whether or not the window is being drawn in the UI, so a visible window
   isn't necessarily actually visible to the user: it might be minimized,
   obscured by a foreground window that's positioned in front of it, or
   positioned outside of the visible area of the display.
