<h1>Javascript Debugging</h1>

<p>
   A good interactive debugger is essential for any non-trivial
   software project.  PinballY doesn't have its own built-in debugger
   window, but it has something better: it lets you connect a <i>real</i>
   debugger.  It currently works with the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Visual Studio Code, Microsoft's free, open-source code
   editor and Javascript IDE

   <li>Chrome DevTools, the debugger console built in to the
   Chrome browser
</ul>

<p>
   Debugging is handled through the Chrome DevTools protocol.
   This is a standard protocol that's implemented by most Windows
   Javascript debuggers and IDEs, so in principle, you should
   be able to use any debugger that implements the protocol.
   However, be warned that the protocol implementation in ChakraCore
   is extremely immature and incomplete.  Microsoft is building
   the debugger interface as a separate project from the main
   ChakraCore engine, and so far they're really only at the
   prototype stage.  They're also only thinking in terms of
   VS Code support, so support for other debuggers (like
   Chrome) is an afterthought at best.  Fortunately,
   they've made it open-source (like Chakra Core itself), so I've
   been able to flesh it out enough to make it fairly usable
   with VS Code and the Chrome debugger.  You <i>might</i> be
   able to get it working with other Javascript debuggers, if
   there's something else you prefer, but it might be a bit
   shaky.
</p>
<p>
   If you run into any problems with debugging, feel free to
   report them as issues, but be aware that it might not be
   practical for me to add any substantial missing features
   until Microsoft makes more progress on this.  Hopefully
   they'll continue developing it and it'll become more
   complete over time. 
</p>

<h2>Visual Studio Code setup</h2>

<p>
   VS Code is Microsoft's free and open-source code editor,
   which can also serve as a fairly full-featured IDE for
   Javascript.  If you don't already have a good code
   editor, you might try VS Code as a combined editor
   and debugging environment.
</p>
<p>
   Full documentation for VS Code is available on
   the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs">VS Code docs site</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Note that you <b>don't</b> have to install the traditional Visual
   Studio (Microsoft's large-scale IDE for system programming languages
   like C++ and C#) to use VS Code.  VS Code is a
   completely independent, standalone program that doesn't depend upon
   Visual Studio in any way, despite the similar name.
</p>
<p>
  Here's the
   full setup procedure, starting from scratch.  If you already have VS
   Code installed, just skip the download-and-install step.
</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Download Visual Studio Code</a>
      from Microsoft and run the installer

      <ul>
         <li><b>What if I already have Visual Studio installed?</b>  That
         makes no difference.  It's a completely unrelated program.  You
         still have to install VS Code separately.
      </ul>

   <li>Launch Visual Studio Code

   <li>On the menu, select File &gt; Open Folder

   <li>That'll bring up a folder selection dialog; navigate to your PinballY &gt; Scripts folder and click Select Folder

   <li>On the main menu again, select Debug &gt; Add Configuration, then select Node.js from
   the popup menu.  That should open a file called <b>launch.json</b> that looks
   something like this:

   <div class="code">
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "program": "${file}"
        }
    ]
}
   </div>

   <li>Replace all of that with the text below:

   <div class="code">
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "PinballY",
            "runtimeExecutable": "${workspaceFolder}/../PinballY.exe",
            "runtimeArgs": ["/jsdebug:port=9228"],
            "port": 9228,
            "protocol": "inspector",
            "stopOnEntry": true
        }
    ]
}
   </div>

   <li>If you want to use a different TCP port number (see <a href="#portnum">Choosing a port number</a>),
   substitute it for the default <b>9228</b> shown above (note that it appears <b>twice</b>,
   once in the "runtimeArgs" line and once in the "port" line; both must always agree)

   <li>Save changes

</ul>

<p>
   VS Code will now be set up to connect to PinballY.  You can return to
   this configuration in future sessions by using File &gt; Select Folder to
   return to the same PinballY Scripts folder, since VS Code keeps its
   configuration data with the folder.
</p>
<p>
   You can go back and manually edit that launch.json file at any time,
   or create it manually yourself.  You'll find it in the <b>.vscode</b>
   folder within your PinballY Scripts folder (or whichever folder
   you selected in the "navigate to your Scripts folder" step above).
</p>

<h3>Starting a debug session with VS Code</h3>

<p>
   This procedure launches PinballY as a child process of the VS Code
   debugger, so you should close any running instance of PinballY first.
</p>
   
<ul>
   <li>Open VS Code

   <li>If your PinballY project folder isn't already open, use File &gt; Open Folder
   to navigate back to your PinballY Scripts folder
   
   <li>Select View &gt; Debug

   <li>At the top of the left panel, make sure the Debug drop list is
   set to <b>PinballY</b>.  If it's not, select that from the drop list.

   <li>Click the big green arrow next to PinballY, or press F5 ("Go"), or
   select Debug &gt; Start Debugging

</ul>

<p>
   PinballY will now launch, and the debugger will take control as soon
   as the first Javascript code starts running.  You can now set breakpoints
   for any code you want to step through, or do any other initial setup for
   the debugging session.  Press F5 to continue execution.
</p>

<h3>Launching PinballY and VS Code separately</h3>

<p>
   You'll probably find it most convenient to launch PinballY directly
   from VS Code as described above, but there's another way to do it.
   You can alternatively launch PinballY yourself, and then "attach"
   VS Code later.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In your launch.json file, change the line that says
   <b>"request":"launch"</b> to read <b>"request":"attach"</b>
   instead.  That setting in VS Code makes the debugger connect to an
   existing process rather than trying to launch a child process.

   <li>Launch PinballY, manually entering the desired /jsdebug command line
   options.  You can do that by creating a Windows desktop shortcut that
   includes the options, or by typing the whole command line into the
   Windows desktop "Run" box (press Windows+R).

   <li>After PinballY has started, go back to VS Code, go to View &gt; Debug,
   and select the modified "attach" configuration in the drop list at
   the top of the debugger panel

   <li>Click the big green arrow or press F5 to start debugging

   <li>VS Code will attach to your already-running PinballY session,
   so you can proceed with debugging activities as normal
</ul>

<h2>Chrome DevTools setup</h2>

<p>
   The Chrome DevTools are built in to the Google Chrome browser, so
   if you have Chrome installed, you already have a nice Javascript
   debugger installed.  The Chrome debugger is more
   of a standalone debugger than a full IDE like VS Code, so you
   might prefer VS Code if you want a more integrated user interface.
   Also note that VS Code support is Microsoft's first
   (and really only) priority, so Chrome support might lag in some ways.
</p>
<p>
   The launching procedure with the Chrome debugger is a little
   different from VS Code.  Chrome won't launch PinballY for you
   the way that VS Code does.  Instead, you have to launch each
   program (Chrome and PinballY) separately, and then tell Chrome
   to connect to the running PinballY instance.  PinballY accommodates this by
   pausing in a "Waiting for debugger" dialog until a debugger
   connects, giving you a chance to intercept the startup scripts
   without any super-human feats of timing.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the setup procedure:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>If you don't already have Google Chrome installed,
      <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">download it</a> and install it.
      You just need the ordinary Chrome browser - the debugger is 
      built in to every copy of Chrome.

   <li>Open the Chrome browser

   <li>In the address bar, type <b>chrome://inspect</b> and press return

   <li>Click the <b>Devices</b> tab in the list on the left (usually
   unnecessary, as this tab should come up by default)

   <li>Make sure the "Discover network targets" checkbox is ticked (it should
   be by default)

   <li>Click the "Configure..." button next to "Discover network targets"

   <li>Add <b>localhost:9228</b> to the port list (or substitute the
   port number of your choice: see <a href="#portnum">Choosing a port number</a>)

   <li>Click Done

   <li>Start PinballY, using the <b>/jsdebug</b> option as described
   in <a href="#jsdebug">/jsdebug option</a>.

   <li>Once PinballY starts up, the Chrome window will show
   a new <b>PinballY</b> entry under the Remote Target list.
   Click its <b>inspect</b> link.

   <li>This will open a new window showing the DevTools debugger
   interface.  You can now set breakpoints, step through code, and
   perform other debugging tasks.
</ul>

<h2>Generic setup for other tools</h2>

<p>
   <b>Warning:</b>  As mentioned earlier, ChakraCore's debugger
   interface is only designed to work with VS Code.  It might work in
   a limited way with other debuggers that implement the Chrome
   DevTools protocol, but many functions are likely to be broken.  Even
   so, I'm documenting the basic setup procedure here for reference,
   in the hope that support for other tools improves in the future.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to try an alternative debugger, here's the generic setup
   procedure.  You'll have to adapt the steps to your debugger's particular
   settings dialogs or configuration file setup, of course.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Start PinballY with Javascript debugging enabled,
   using the <a href="#jsdebug"><b>/jsdebug</b></a> command-line option

   <li>Run the debugger or IDE as a separate process

   <li>The debugger connects to PinballY via a numbered TCP port
   (local network port)

   <li>The port number is up to you (see <a href="#portnum">Choosing a port</a>)

   <li>You have to configure <i>both</i> PinballY and your debugger/IDE
   to use the port number you chose

   <li>You initiate the debugging session by telling your debugger/IDE
   to connect to the selected port, after PinballY has started
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Startup procedure:</b>  By default, when you use <b>/jsdebug</b>
   to start PinballY in Javascript debugging mode, PinballY waits for
   a debugger to connect before doing anything else.  As soon as the
   debugger connects, PinballY loads its own built-in Javascript code,
   then stops in the debugger just before the first line of your
   <b>main.js</b> script is executed.  This gives you a chance to
   step through your script code from the beginning if you want to.
   You can simply use your debugger's "Go" or "Continue" command if
   you don't need to step through your startup code.
</p>

<h3>Choosing a port number</h3>

<p>
   The "port number" we've referred to a number of times is a local TCP port
   number.  This is a type of network port, but in this case it doesn't actually
   access your LAN or Internet connection; it's just for local connections between
   programs running on your computer.  The port number simply identifies the
   port so that the applications can connect to each other.
</p>
<p>
   Any port from 1024 to 49151 is
   valid, as long as the port isn't already in use by some other program.
   The default port is 9228, which isn't used by any common software
   that I know of.  PinballY will show an error at startup if you choose
   a port that's already in use; if you see such an error, simply choose
   a different number in the valid range.
</p>
<p>
   The range of valid ports is so large that it's usually easy to find
   a free port by just choosing one randomly.  However, if you want to
   see a list of exactly which ports are in use on your computer, type
   <b>netstat /an</b> into a CMD prompt window.  Look for entries in the
   "Local address" column with address 127.0.0.1: the number after the
   ":" is the port number.
</p>

<p>
   <b>How to tell PinballY which port to use:</b>  On the PinballY
   command line, enter the port number like this (substituting the port
   number of your choice for the default 9228):
</p>
<div class="indented">
PinballY.exe /jsdebug:port=9228
</div>

<p>
   <b>How to tell your debugger which port to use:</b>  That's different
   for each debugger.  For VS Code, you enter it in the launch.json file
   under the "port" setting.  For Chrome, you add it to the "network
   targets" list as <b>localhost:<i>port</i></b>.
</p>

<a name="jsdebug"></a>
<h2>/jsdebug option syntax</h2>

<p>
   The <b>/jsdebug</b> command-line option tells PinballY to enable
   Javascript debugging.  Debugging is disabled by default, since it
   adds a little bit of performance overhead.
</p>

<p>
   /jsdebug by itself enables debugging and selects a number
   of default settings.  You can change the defaults by adding some
   extra options to the /jsdebug parameter.  Write these as
   <b>/jsdebug:<i>option,option,...</i></b>.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>port=<i>portNumber</i>:</b> Sets the TCP port number for the
   connection between the VS Code debugger and PinballY's Javascript
   engine.  The default is port 9228, but any assignable TCP port
   (1024 to 49151) can be used.  You can change  this to a different port if you have
   some other software on your system that's already using this port.
   This is a TCP port, so it's network-related, but it's not <i>really</i>
   a network port; it's on "localhost", which means that it's only
   for connections within the same machine, and doesn't connect to
   anything outside via your LAN or Internet.
   
   <li><b>break=<i>where</i>:</b>  Sets the initial "break" position
   where the debugger takes control and pauses the Javascript
   program.  This can be one of the following:
   <ul>
      <li><b>break=user:</b> This is the default.  The debugger will
      initially stop at the first line or your main.js script,
      skipping the boilerplate system setup code that PinballY
      executes before loading your script.
      
      <li><b>break=system:</b>  The debugger will pause initially at the
      first line of the boilerplate system code that PinballY
      executes on startup.  You can use this if you want to look at
      what the system code is doing out of curiosity or because
      you want to debug something going wrong there.
      
      <li><b>break=none:</b>  The debugger won't initially pause at all.
      You can use this if you don't need to debug any of your
      startup code and want to control things manually via
      breakpoints or the "pause" button in the debugger UI.
      <p>
         Tip: Visual Studio Code gets a little confused by this option,
         because it doesn't pay attention to the target engine's run
         state correctly.  After starting up with this option, VS Code will <i>think</i>
         it's paused in the debugger, but PinballY will actually be
         running.  Just click the "Go" button in VS Code to get it
         back in sync with reality.  Alternatively, you can set
         the "stopOnEntry:" parameter in launch.json to false, to
         tell Code not to expect the initial break in the first
         place, but I don't like that as much because you'll have to
         remember to set it back if you change the /jsdebug:break
         setting later.  I find it easier to just do the extra "Go" click.
      </p>
   </ul>

   <li><b>wait=<i>yesOrNo</i></b>:  Tells PinballY whether or not it should
   wait for the debugger to establish its connection before proceeding
   to execute any Javascript code.  The default is <b>wait=yes</b>.
   Waiting for the connection ensures that the debugger has a chance
   to establish preconfigured breakpoints before any code is executed.
   This option is useful if you want to launch PinballY separately from
   the debugger, and wait to attach the debugger at a later time.

</ul>
<p>
   If you want to use more than one of those options together, separate
   them with commas:
</p>
<div class="indented">
PinballY.exe  /jsdebug:port=9228,break=system
</div>
