<h1>Transparent videos</h1>

<p>
   Starting with version 1.0 beta 17, PinballY is capable of
   showing videos with "alpha" transparency information embedded
   in the video, as well as animated GIF files with transparency.
</p>
<p>
   Alpha transparency is probably a familiar concept if you've
   done any work with image editors.  Image formats like PNG can
   represent partially transparent pixels, so that one image can
   be superimposed on top of another one, with areas of the background
   image showing through areas of the top image.
</p>
<p>
   There's a separate kind of transparency used in GIF images,
   where a pixel color in the image is designated as the "invisible
   ink" color.  All pixels in the image that match the designated
   invisible ink color are drawn as though there
   were completely transparent, and all other pixels are opaque.
   This is less sophisticated than alpha transparency, since
   it only allows an all-or-nothing kind of transparency, whereas
   alpha allows for continuous gradations of partial transparency.
</p>

<h2>Where can transparent videos be used in PinballY?</h2>

<p>
   Quick answer: transparent videos can be used anywhere videos can be used.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY uses transparent rendering for all videos that contain alpha channel information, regardless
   of context.  Alpha transparency is a property of the video itself,
   so PinballY simply uses alpha for a video if the video has alpha information
   in the first place.
</p>
<p>
   This applies to all videos, including the background videos
   in the playfield window and other windows.  However, it's not
   particularly useful for background videos, because there's
   nothing "behind" them to show through the transparent areas
   in the video - just a black background.  Any completely transparent
   areas in a background video will thus be filled with
   black, and partially transparent areas will effectively look like
   they're shown at reduced brightness, as they'll be mixed
   proportionally with the black background.
</p>
<p>
   Transparency is therefore really only useful for videos that
   are layered on top of other display areas.  Currently, PinballY
   uses layered videos in the following contexts:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Custom drawing layers.  You can play a video in any
   custom drawing layer, and since these can be layered on top
   of other graphics, they can benefit from transparency in
   the video source material.
   See <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>.

   <li>Launch overlays.  A launch overlay is layered on top of the
   main playfield window, so transparent areas in a launch overlay
   video will show the playfield video and other elements of the
   normal wheel UI in the main window. 
   See <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html">Launch overlay events</a>
   and <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Animated GIFs</h2>

<p>
   The most popular current "video" format with transparency support isn't
   really a video format at all: it's the GIF image file format.
   GIF files support a simple sort of animation where a single
   GIF file can store a series of image frames that are played
   back sequentially on a timer.  It's not exactly a "video"
   format in the usual sense, and it's not useful for anything
   lengthy because it doesn't compress well,
   but it's widely used on the Web for creating animated icons
   and short video loops.  GIF also has a simple form of transparency,
   so it can be used for animated overlays - just the sort of
   thing you'd use alpha-channel video for.
</p>
<p>
   Starting in 1.0 beta 17, PinballY supports animated GIF files,
   including transparent animated GIFs.  You can use an animated GIF
   anywhere a regular still image can be used.
</p>
<p>
   It might seem a bit strange, but note that all GIF files
   are considered <b>image files</b> in PinballY, never video files -
   even when animated.  That's sometimes important when you're
   deciding where to store a particular media file.  The rule
   is really simple: if it's a GIF file, treat it like an image
   file.  Always put GIF files in the PinballY media folders designated for
   image files; don't put GIF files in video folders.
</p>
   

<h2>Supported video formats with alpha channels</h2>

<p>
   As of this writing, alpha channel support in the standard video
   formats is quite limited.  It's not supported at all in
   the most common formats and codecs, including MP4 and H.264.
   (That's not because of PinballY limitations or libvlc
   limitations - it's inherent in the formats.)
</p>
<p>
   The only video file formats that currently support alpha appear
   to be MOV (Apple's QuickTime video format), FLV (Adobe Flash Video),
   and AVI (Windows).  However, that's hardly the full story, because
   you also have to use a codec that supports alpha.  Here's a list
   of what works now:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>AVI files: PNG codec
   <li>FLV files: PNG codec
   <li>MOV files: PNG, QTRLE, or Apple's ProRes_KS with YUVA 4:4:4:4 at 10 bits per pixel (yuva444p10le)
</ul>
<p>
   Note that "PNG" in this context is a <i>video codec</i>, not
   a file format.  (It does happen to use the PNG image format to encode
   each frame within the video, which is why the name is reused in this
   somewhat confusing way.)  A PNG-encoded video stream can be stored in an AVI or FLV file.
   You can encode videos this way with ffmpeg, for example.
</p>
<p>
   PNG and QTRLE are usable only for very short clips, because they
   use lossless encodings that result in extremely poor compression
   ratios compared to what we're accustomed to with modern video
   codecs like MP4 or H.264.  So at the moment, the ProRes YUVA 4:4:4:4
   format is really the only good option for full video.  Fortunately,
   ProRes seems to be a high-quality format with great alpha
   support, so there's at least one good option.
</p>
<p>
   This list might eventually grow, and it sure seems primed for
   growth given how sparse it is, but I actually don't see it
   growing quickly or soon.   Alpha channel support in video
   seems to be a difficult technical problem that's of little
   interest to the video engineering community.  It doesn't
   seem that anyone except the Apple ProRes group has given
   it much thought.  (That makes ProRes a curious anomaly:
   computer technologies usually develop incrementally,
   with a series of false starts and half measures before
   a good solution appears.  But in this case, it seems
   like no one else  was even trying, and along comes Apple
   to just solve it for real.)
</p>

<h2>Creating alpha channel video from chroma-keyed ("green screen") material</h2>

<p>
   Even though alpha channel support in video formats seems to be a
   work in progress that's barely begun, the concept of motion overlays is hardly new.
   It goes back to film-based special effects.  Traditionally,
   layered film and video composition was handled with an entirely different
   process, called chroma keying.  This is also known as the
   "green screen" or "blue screen" technique, because it's
   widely used in film and video productions to shoot a live
   subject against a green or blue backdrop that's replaced
   in the final editing process with a special effects background.
</p>
<p>
   In chroma keying, there isn't a separate "alpha" channel that
   records which pixels are opaque and which are transparent.
   Instead, you simply treat all pixels that match the key
   color as transparent.  Every pixel that matches the key color
   is transparent, and the rest are opaque.
</p>
<p>
   The reason I mention chroma keying is that it's been used
   for a long time in film and video production, so there's
   a lot of stock footage on the Web that uses this technique.
   If you're looking for material to use for overlay videos,
   you'll probably find lots of chroma-keyed videos and few
   videos using an alpha-channel format.  But PinballY can
   only use alpha-channel videos, so chroma-keyed videos
   will have to be converted.  That's something that FFMPEG
   (the popular open-source video converter program) can
   accomplish.  Here's a fairly simple procedure you can use:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, identify the key color.  An easy way to do this
   is to play the video in any video player, and take a screen
   shot of any frame showing the background color.  Open up
   the screen shot in a photo editor and use the "eyedropper"
   tool to pick the pixel color.  Note its hex RGB value.
   Most photo editors these days will give you an
   HTML "#" code for each color, like "#00FF00" for bright
   green.  That's the hex RGB value.

   <li>Now fire up a CMD prompt, and enter the following 
   ffmpeg command.  (I know it's awfully long and ugly, but
   you can mostly just copy and paste it.)
   You can use the copy of ffmpeg that's
   in your PinballY install folder.  Replace the <b>0x00ff00</b>
   part in the <b>chromakey</b> section with the hex RGB color value you noted above.
   (Note that this all goes on one command line in the CMD window - it's
   very long so it'll probably wrap as displayed here.)
   <div class="indented commandline">
ffmpeg -i <i>source_video_file</i> -vf "chromakey=0x00ff00:0.01:0.01" -codec prores_ks -pix_fmt yuva444p10le -f mov <i>output_file_name</i>.mov
   </div>
   <p>
      Note that there are two extra parameters in the <b>chromakey</b>
      section, following the hex RGB color value, which you might
      also want to play with to optimize the conversion.  The
      first <b>0.01</b> value is the "tolerance" for matching
      the key color.  0.01 is 1% tolerance, meaning that the
      color has to match almost exactly.  This works well for
      computer-generated videos with perfectly uniform backgrounds,
      but material with a live subject against a green screen
      might have a lot more variation in the background.  Adjust
      this upwards if areas of the background remain opaque in
      the converted video.  The second <b>0.01</b> value sets
      how much of a transparency ramp is used to adjust pixels
      that are close to the background color but not exact.
      Again, a small value like .01 is good for computer-generated
      material; this will result in sharp edges around the
      subject.  A higher value will make the edges appear softer
      by making them partially transparent, which might look better
      with live subjects.  But too high a value will make the
      subject look too transparent, so you might have to
      experiment to find the right value for a given video.
   </p>
</ul>
