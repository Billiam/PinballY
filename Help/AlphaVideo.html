<h1>Notes on videos with "Alpha" transparency</h1>

<p>
   Starting with version 1.0 beta 17, PinballY is capable of
   showing videos with "alpha" transparency information embedded
   in the video.
</p>
<p>
   Alpha transparency is probably a familiar concept if you've
   done any work with image editors.  Image formats like PNG can
   represent partially transparent pixels, so that one image can
   be superimposed on top of another one, with areas of the background
   image showing through areas of the top image.  Alpha transparency
   in videos is very similar, with each individual frame in the
   video having its own transparency mask.  This allows for
   complex compositions where moving images are layered on top
   of a background video.
</p>

<h2>Where alpha videos can be used in PinballY</h2>

<p>
   PinballY uses alpha for all videos that have it, regardless
   of context.  Alpha transparency is a property of the video itself,
   so PinballY simply uses alpha for a video if the video has alpha information
   in the first place.
</p>
<p>
   This applies to all videos, including the background videos
   in the playfield window and other windows.  However, it's not
   particularly useful for background videos, because there's
   nothing "behind" them to show through the transparent areas
   in the video - just a black background.  Any completely transparent
   areas in a background video will thus be filled with
   black, and partially transparent areas will effectively look like
   they're shown at reduced brightness, as they'll be mixed
   proportionally with the black background.
</p>
<p>
   Transparency is therefore really only useful for videos that
   are layered on top of other display areas.  Currently, PinballY
   uses layered videos in the following contexts:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Launch overlays.  A launch overlay is layered on top of the
   main playfield window, so transparent areas in a launch overlay
   video will show the playfield video and other elements of the
   normal wheel UI in the main window. 
   See <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html">Launch overlay events</a>
   and <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay</a>.

   <li>Custom drawing layers.  You can play a video in any
   custom drawing layer, and since these can be layered on top
   of other graphics, they can benefit from transparency in
   the video source material.
   See <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>.
</ul>

<h2>Animated GIFs</h2>

<p>
   The most popular current "video" format with transparency support isn't
   really a video format at all: it's the GIF image file format.
   GIF files can be animated, by storing multiple image frames
   and showing them sequentially on a timer.  It's not exactly
   a video format in the usual sense, but the effect is similar,
   and it's widely used on the Web for creating animated icons
   and short video loops.  GIF also has a simple form of transparency,
   so it can be used for animated overlays - just the sort of
   thing you'd use alpha-channel video for.
</p>
<p>
   Unfortunately, PinballY doesn't support animated GIF files.  (It
   does support GIF as a still-image format, and it'll <i>load</i>
   animated GIFs, but it'll only display the first frame,
   as though you had pressed the pause button.)
</p>
<p>
   GIFs might be your best source for overlay images, though,
   so I'm going to give you an easy recipe for converting an
   animated transparent GIF into an alpha-channel video format that
   PinballY can use.  You can do this conversion using the
   version of FFMPEG that comes with PinballY, or you can
   use your own copy of FFMPEG if you've installed it
   separately.  This converts a GIF into a MOV (Apple QuickTime
   video) file with alpha transparency.  Type this into a CMD window
   (note that this all goes on a single command line - it's extra
   long, so it might wrap to multiple lines here):
</p>
<div class="indented commandline">
ffmpeg -i <i>source_file</i>.gif -codec prores_ks -pix_fmt yuva444p10le -f mov <i>output_file</i>.mov   
</div>
   

<h2>Supported video formats with alpha channels</h2>

<p>
   As of this writing, alpha channel support in the standard video
   formats is quite limited.  It's not supported at all in
   the most common formats and codecs, including MP4 and H.264.
   (That's not because of PinballY limitations or libvlc
   limitations - it's inherent in the formats.)
</p>
<p>
   The only video file formats that currently support alpha appear
   to be MOV (Apple's QuickTime video format), FLV (Adobe Flash Video),
   and AVI (Windows).  However, that's hardly the full story, because
   you also have to use a codec that supports alpha.  Here's a list
   of what works now:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>AVI files: PNG codec
   <li>FLV files: PNG codec
   <li>MOV files: PNG, QTRLE, or Apple's ProRes_KS with YUVA 4:4:4:4 at 10 bits per pixel (yuva444p10le)
</ul>
<p>
   Note that "PNG" in this context is a <i>video codec</i>, not
   a file format.  (It does happen to use the PNG image format to encode
   each frame within the video, which is why the name is reused in this
   somewhat confusing way.)  A PNG-encoded video stream can be stored in an AVI or FLV file.
   You can encode videos this way with ffmpeg, for example.
</p>
<p>
   PNG and QTRLE are usable only for very short clips, because they
   use lossless encodings that result in extremely poor compression
   ratios compared to what we're accustomed to with modern video
   codecs like MP4 or H.264.  So at the moment, the ProRes YUVA 4:4:4:4
   format is really the only good option for full video.  Fortunately,
   ProRes seems to be a high-quality format with great alpha
   support, so there's at least one good option.
</p>
<p>
   This list might eventually grow, and it sure seems primed for
   growth given how sparse it is, but I actually don't see it
   growing quickly or soon.   Alpha channel support in video
   seems to be a difficult technical problem that's of little
   interest to the video engineering community.  It doesn't
   seem that anyone except the Apple ProRes group has given
   it much thought.  (That makes ProRes a curious anomaly:
   computer technologies usually develop incrementally,
   with a series of false starts and half measures before
   a good solution appears.  But in this case, it seems
   like no one else  was even trying, and along comes Apple
   to just solve it for real.)
</p>

<h2>Creating alpha channel video from chroma-keyed material</h2>

<p>
   Even though alpha channel support in video formats seems to be a
   work in progress that's barely begun, the concept of motion overlays is hardly new.
   It goes back to film-based special effects.  Traditionally,
   layered film and video composition was handled with an entirely different
   process, called "chroma keying".  This is also known as
   "green screen" or "blue screen" effects.
</p>
<p>
   In chroma keying, rather than using a separate channel to
   indicate which pixels are opaque and which are transparent, you
   use a special "key" color within the image to mark the transparent pixels.
   Every pixel that matches the key color is transparent, and the rest
   are opaque.  This technique has been used for a long time in
   film and video special effects because it works well when
   the subject is live rather than computer-generated.  You
   shoot the subject against a backdrop that's painted uniformly
   with the key color - the "green screen", as it's commonly
   called, because that's the color usually used in video production.
   You can then superimpose the subject onto a different background
   later by replacing all of the green-screen pixels with the
   separate background layer.  It's the technique they use to
   show the weather map behind the announcer on the local news.
</p>
<p>
   The reason I mention chroma keying is that there's a lot of
   stock video on the Web that uses the chroma key technique,
   and very little that uses alpha.  If you're looking for
   material to use for overlay videos, you might have an
   easier time finding chroma-keyed videos.  To use these in
   PinballY as transparent overlays, you'll need to convert
   them to use alpha channels.  So here's a handy recipe
   you can use:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, identify the key color.  An easy way to do this
   is to play the video in any video player, and take a screen
   shot of any frame showing the background color.  Open up
   the screen shot in a photo editor and use the "eyedropper"
   tool to pick the pixel color.  Note its hex RGB value.
   Most photo editors these days will give you an
   HTML "#" code for each color, like "#00FF00" for bright
   green.  That's the hex RGB value.

   <li>Now fire up a CMD prompt, and enter the following magical
   incantation to ffmpeg.  You can use the copy of ffmpeg that's
   in your PinballY install folder.  Replace the <b>0x00ff00</b>
   part in the <b>chromakey</b> section with the hex RGB color value you noted above.
   (Note that this all goes on one command line in the CMD window - it's
   very long so it'll probably wrap as displayed here.)
   <div class="indented commandline">
ffmpeg -i <i>source_video_file</i> -vf "chromakey=0x00ff00:0.01:0.01" -codec prores_ks -pix_fmt yuva444p10le -f mov <i>output_file_name</i>.mov
   </div>
   <p>
      Note that there are two extra parameters in the <b>chromakey</b>
      section, following the hex RGB color value, which you might
      also want to play with to optimize the conversion.  The
      first <b>0.01</b> value is the "tolerance" for matching
      the key color.  0.01 is 1% tolerance, meaning that the
      color has to match almost exactly.  This works well for
      computer-generated videos with perfectly uniform backgrounds,
      but material with a live subject against a green screen
      might have a lot more variation in the background.  Adjust
      this upwards if areas of the background remain opaque in
      the converted video.  The second <b>0.01</b> value sets
      how much of a transparency ramp is used to adjust pixels
      that are close to the background color but not exact.
      Again, a small value like .01 is good for computer-generated
      material; this will result in sharp edges around the
      subject.  A higher value will make the edges appear softer
      by making them partially transparent, which might look better
      with live subjects.  But too high a value will make the
      subject look too transparent, so you might have to
      experiment to find the right value for a given video.
   </p>
</ul>
