<h1>Usage Tips</h1>

<p>
   PinballY aims to be easy enough to use that you don't need a manual,
   so anything I have to write down here is kind of a failure on that
   score.  My hope is that you'll be able to find everything yourself
   by exploring the UI.  But it's worth mentioning a few things that
   might not jump out at you the first few times you use the program.
</p>

<h2>Arranging windows</h2>
<p>
   You can arrange all of the PinballY windows just like any other
   Windows program's windows.  Just drag them where you want them
   and resize them as needed.  Right-click in a window to hide it
   entirely, or to switch to
   full-screen mode or "borderless" mode (which hides all of the normal
   Windows caption and border controls).
</p>

<h2>Main menu</h2>
<p>
   When you're browsing games, you can access
   the Main Menu at any time by pressing the Start button (the
   "1" key by default, but you can of course change this in
   the options).  The Main Menu has commands to launch the
   game in its pinball player program, view the
   game's full details, show the game's instruction cards and
   promotional flyers, give the game a "star" rating, add it
   to your favorites, and select various "filters".
</p>


<h2>Right-click menus</h2>
<p>
   Some of the more frequently accessed window
   layout and setup options are available as right-click menu options.
   Try right-clicking in each window to see the available commands.
</p>

<h2>Game list filters</h2>
<p>
   The Main Menu provides options for a
   whole bunch of filters, which let you select a subset of
   games to display in the wheel.  This can make it easier
   to find games if you have a large collection.  The filters
   let you select games by era, manufacturer, player system,
   star ratings, how long it's been since you last played
   them, how long it's been since you installed them, and
   by any category tags you create yourself.
</p>

<h2>Operator menu</h2>
<p>
   PinballY makes many of the basic
   game setup functions and global program options available
   through the "Operator Menu", which you can access by pressing
   the "Service Enter" button on your coin door service button
   panel, if you have one.  If you don't, you can access this
   menu via the Exit menu, which you can reach by pressing the
   Exit/Cancel button.  See <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>
   for more details.
</p>


<a name="categories"></a>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>
   The Operator Menu lets you set up
   categories, which are essentially "tags" that you can
   apply to each game.  Edit a game's categories by going
   to the Operator Menu &gt; Game Setup &gt; Select
   Categories.  You can add your own categories from
   there via the Edit Category Names command.  You can
   assign any number of categories to each game.  Once
   you've set up a category, it'll appear under the
   category filter menu, which you can reach from the 
   Main Menu via the Filter by Category command.
</p>
<p>
   If you're migrating from PinballX, you might have been using PinballX's
   "Lists" feature to create ad hoc groupings of games.  PinballX handled
   "Lists" by grouping games into separate XML database files; each "List"
   was a separate XML file.  PinballY recognizes that method of organizing
   the XML files and automatically translates each "List" entry into a
   Category.  So you should find that your games are already tagged with
   your existing list names if you're using XML files you created with PinballX.
   If you're accustomed to using PinballX to "filter by list", you can use
   "filter by category" in PinballY to do the same thing.  The Categories
   feature gives you some additional flexibility, too: you can assign any
   number of categories to a single game, and you can do it through the
   wheel UI, without the need to edit the XML files or switch to a separate
   editor program.
</p>


<h2>Unconfigured table files</h2>
<p>
   By default, the list of
   games shown in the "wheel" includes all table files that
   PinballY finds in the "tables" folders for your installed
   systems, even if they haven't been set up with titles, media,
   and other details yet.  You'll be able to spot these easily
   because they'll be shown with default background images,
   and the raw filename will be used in place of a title.
</p>
<p>
   This notion of including configured and unconfigured games
   side-by-side probably won't appeal to everyone's tastes.
   I like it because it makes it easy to see everything on
   my cab.  I don't have to go hunting through my table
   folders to see what's there and what needs my attention.
   And giving it the needed attention is easy: just select
   Game Setup from the Operator Menu and you can enter
   details, download media, and capture videos, right
   from the keyboard menus.  Setting up new games was a bit
   of a chore in the older systems; I find this new way
   to be a lot easier and faster.
   But if you think this is stupid, no problem.  Open up the
   Options dialog; go to the Game Wheel page; check the
   box for "Hide unconfigured games".
</p>
<p>
   You probably have some tables that you never intend to
   add to the game list, such as backup copies or
   test games.  Don't worry - you can easily kick these out
   of the list.  Just bring up the Operator Menu and select
   "Hide Game".  That will relegate the game to a separate
   Hidden list that will never show up - unless you
   specifically ask to see the hidden games by selecting
   "Show Hidden Games" from the Operator Menu.

<h2>Startup audio/video</h2>
<p>
   You can make PinballY play
   a custom video and/or audio file each time the program
   starts up.  See <a href="StartupAudioVideo.html">Startup Audio/Video</a>
   for details.
</p>

<h2>Admin mode</h2>
<p>
   A lot of pin cab users are accustomed to running some or all of
   their software in "Administrator Mode".  You really shouldn't do
   this, since it makes your system more vulnerable to damage by
   malware, or even by bugs in otherwise benign software, but some
   pin cab people do it anyway.
</p>
<p>
   Most people who run everything in Admin Mode do it because someone
   told them they should.  In most cases, that's bad advice that people
   on the forums hand out because they don't know what else to try,
   and you even find it repeated in a number of FAQs and setup guides.
   If that's the only reason you're using Admin Mode -  because
   someone told you to - my advice would
   be to stop it.  You should only use Admin Mode if you have a special
   situation that really requires it.  Those special situations are
   increasingly rare, because they were mostly caused by bugs that
   have been getting fixed as time goes on.  Most of the software
   in the pin cab ecosystem that <i>formerly</i> required Admin Mode has
   been fixed at this point, so even if you can articulate the exact
   reason you needed Admin Mode at some point in the past, you might
   want to check again, since that problem might have been fixed in
   a recent update.
</p>
<p>
   If you're unfortunate enough to have a real need for Admin Mode
   for a particular program, you should still try to minimize Admin
   Mode usage by restricting it to the particular program or combination
   of programs that are causing problems.   PinballY has some features
   can help, which you can read about in <a href="AdminMode.html">Admin Mode</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The big thing that you <i>shouldn't</i> do with PinballY
   is to run the main PinballY.exe program in Admin mode.  You might
   be used to doing that with other front ends, but there's a better way
   with PinballY.  Instead of running PinballY.exe in Admin Mode, 
   run the separate <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b>
   program.  That program identifies itself to Windows
   as requiring Admin privileges, so you don't have to explicitly
   set the "Run as Admin" checkbox in the properties, and you
   don't have to use the "Run as Admin" command from the desktop.
   Just run it like a normal program and it'll automatically
   use Admin mode.  (You'll still see the usual User Access Control
   [UAC] warning from Windows asking for your permission to do
   this.)  When you use this approach, PinballY will be able
   to launch games that don't need Admin Mode in regular user mode,
   rather than being forced
   to launch everything in Admin Mode, which is what happens when
   you run the whole front end in Admin Mode.  Only the minimal set of programs that you designate
   as actually needing Admin Mode will be launched in Admin Mode.
