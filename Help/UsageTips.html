<h1>Usage Tips</h1>

<p>
   PinballY aims to be easy enough to use that you don't need a manual,
   so anything I have to write down here is kind of a failure on that
   score.  My hope is that you'll be able to find everything yourself
   by exploring the UI.  But it's worth mentioning a few things that
   might not jump out at you the first few times you use the program.
</p>

<h2>Arranging windows</h2>
<p>
   You can arrange all of the PinballY windows just like any other
   Windows program's windows.  Just drag them where you want them
   and resize them as needed.  Right-click in a window to hide it
   entirely, or to switch to
   full-screen mode or "borderless" mode (which hides all of the normal
   Windows caption and border controls).
</p>

<h2>Main menu</h2>
<p>
   When you're browsing games, you can access
   the Main Menu at any time by pressing the Start button (the
   "1" key by default, but you can of course change this in
   the options).  The Main Menu has commands to launch the
   game in its pinball player program, view the
   game's full details, show the game's instruction cards and
   promotional flyers, give the game a "star" rating, add it
   to your favorites, and select various "filters".
</p>


<h2>Right-click menus</h2>
<p>
   Some of the more frequently accessed window
   layout and setup options are available as right-click menu options.
   Try right-clicking in each window to see the available commands.
</p>

<h2>Game list filters</h2>
<p>
   The Main Menu provides options for a
   whole bunch of filters, which let you select a subset of
   games to display in the wheel.  This can make it easier
   to find games if you have a large collection.  The filters
   let you select games by era, manufacturer, player system,
   star ratings, how long it's been since you last played
   them, how long it's been since you installed them, and
   by any category tags you create yourself.
</p>

<h2>Operator menu</h2>
<p>
   PinballY makes many of the basic
   game setup functions and global program options available
   through the "Operator Menu", which you can access by pressing
   the "Service Enter" button on your coin door service button
   panel, if you have one.  If you don't, you can access this
   menu via the Exit menu, which you can reach by pressing the
   Exit/Cancel button.  See <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a>
   for more details.
</p>


<a name="categories"></a>
<h2>Categories</h2>
<p>
   The Operator Menu lets you set up
   categories, which are essentially "tags" that you can
   apply to each game.  Edit a game's categories by going
   to the Operator Menu &gt; Game Setup &gt; Select
   Categories.  You can add your own categories from
   there via the Edit Category Names command.  You can
   assign any number of categories to each game.  Once
   you've set up a category, it'll appear under the
   category filter menu, which you can reach from the 
   Main Menu via the Filter by Category command.
</p>

<h2>Unconfigured table files</h2>
<p>
   By default, the list of
   games shown in the "wheel" includes all table files that
   PinballY finds in the "tables" folders for your installed
   systems, even if they haven't been set up with titles, media,
   and other details yet.  You'll be able to spot these easily
   because they'll be shown with default background images,
   and the raw filename will be used in place of a title.
</p>
<p>
   This notion of including configured and unconfigured games
   side-by-side probably won't appeal to everyone's tastes.
   I like it because it makes it easy to see everything on
   my cab.  I don't have to go hunting through my table
   folders to see what's there and what needs my attention.
   And giving it the needed attention is easy: just select
   Game Setup from the Operator Menu and you can enter
   details, download media, and capture videos, right
   from the keyboard menus.  Setting up new games was a bit
   of a chore in the older systems; I find this new way
   to be a lot easier and faster.
   But if you think this is stupid, no problem.  Open up the
   Options dialog; go to the Game Wheel page; check the
   box for "Hide unconfigured games".
</p>
<p>
   You probably have some tables that you never intend to
   add to the game list, such as backup copies or
   test games.  Don't worry - you can easily kick these out
   of the list.  Just bring up the Operator Menu and select
   "Hide Game".  That will relegate the game to a separate
   Hidden list that will never show up - unless you
   specifically ask to see the hidden games by selecting
   "Show Hidden Games" from the Operator Menu.
</p>

<h2>Startup audio/video</h2>
<p>
   You can make PinballY play
   a custom video and/or audio file each time the program
   starts up.  See <a href="StartupAudioVideo.html">Startup Audio/Video</a>
   for details.
</p>

<h2>Admin mode</h2>
<p>
   A lot of pin cab users are accustomed
   to having to run some or all of their software in "Administrator
   Mode", meaning that you give the software full system privileges
   as though it were a core operating system component.  It's
   best to minimize this, since Admin Mode opens up your system to
   more risks from malware and program bugs, but many pin cab users
   just give up and run everything in Admin mode to work around
   weird problems.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY has some features can will help you at least
   reduce Admin mode usage.  Ideally, you should be able to
   eliminate Admin mode entirely, but you might have some programs
   that really do require it for one reason or another.
</p>
<p>
   The big thing that you <i>shouldn't</i> do with PinballY
   is to run the main PinballY.exe program in Admin mode.  You might
   be used  to doing that with other front ends, but don't do it
   with PinballY.  Instead, if you find that you must use
   Admin mode, run the separate <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b>
   program instead.  That program identifies itself to Windows
   as requiring Admin privileges, so you don't have to explicitly
   set the "Run as Admin" checkbox in the properties and you
   don't have to use the "Run as Admin" command from the desktop.
   Just run it like a normal program and it'll automatically
   use Admin mode.  (You'll still see a User Access Control
   [UAC] warning from Windows asking for your permission to do
   this, so this isn't some kind of end run around the Windows
   security system.)
