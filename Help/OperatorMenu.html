<h1>Operator Menu</h1>

<p>
   PinballY has a "hidden" menu for special setup functions, known
   as the Operator Menu.  This menu is intentionally somewhat hidden,
   so that it doesn't clutter up the screen with technical options
   during normal play, and so that you don't have to worry about
   "civilians" playing games on your cab accidentally messing up
   your configuration by accessing setup functions.
</p>
<img src="OperatorMenu.jpg" class="example">
<p>
   By default, the Operator menu is accessed with the "0" (digit zero)
   key.  (That's the digit zero, not the letter O).  This is the
   default key assignment because it matches the VPinMAME mapping
   for the "Service Enter/Select" button, which corresponds to the
   button on a real pinball machine that the owner/operator would
   use to access the machine's setup menu.  On a real machine, this
   button is hidden inside the locked coin door, to prevent
   any teenagers at the arcade from adding 10,000 credits or
   setting the reply score to 10 points.  If you're running
   PinballY on a pin cab with a real coin door, and you've set
   up your coin door service buttons with the VPinMAME mappings,
   then you can access the PinballY Operator Menu using that
   same coin door button you'd use to bring up the Operator
   Menu on any WPC game.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to remap the Operator Menu to some other key,
   open the Settings dialog, go to the Buttons page, and change
   the assignment for the <b>Service 4/Enter</b> button.
</p>

<h2>Command descriptions</h2>

<p>
   <b>Game Setup:</b>  Brings up the <a href="GameSetupMenu.html">Game Setup menu</a>,
   which has commands for configuring the currently selected game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="batchCapture">,/a>
   <b>Batch Capture:</b>  Starts a batch capture, which lets you capture
   videos and background images for multiple games in one operation.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Show Hidden Games:</b>  Selects the "hidden games only" filter, which makes
   the wheel UI show all of the games that you've previously marked as "hidden".
   You can mark a game as hidden when you want to keep it from showing up in
   the normal wheel UI; for example, you can hide old versions of games that
   you no longer want to play but still want to keep around as backups or
   for reference purposes.  The "hidden games" filter lets you review all
   of the games you've previously hidden, which can be useful if you want
   to un-hide a game.
</p>
<p>
   To return to the normal display, you can either select a different
   filter (including "All Tables") from the main menu, or you can return
   to the Operator Menu and un-check the Show Hidden Games option.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Show Unconfigured Games:</b>  Selects the "unconfigured games only"
   filter, which makes the wheel UI show only games that don't have any
   details entered.  This can be useful if you want to methodically
   go through your games and enter details for any games that aren't
   already configured.
</p>
<p>
   To return to the normal display, you can either select a different
   filter (including "All Tables") from the main menu, or you can return
   to the Operator Menu and un-check the Show Unconfigured Games option.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Reset Coins/Credits:</b>  Zeroes the internal counters for coins
   and credits.
</p>

   <b>PinballY Options:</b>  Shows the <a href="Options.html">Options dialog</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Enable Videos:</b>  Check or un-check this item to allow or disable
   video playback.  If you un-check this, still images will be displayed instead
   of any videos for all of the windows.
</p>

<p>
