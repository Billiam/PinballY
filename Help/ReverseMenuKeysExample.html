<h1>Reversed Menu Buttons</h1>

<p>
   PinballY lets you reassign all of the standard keyboard and joystick
   command assignments via the <a href="Options.html">Options</a> dialog,
   so it's straightforward to customize the button settings for your
   pin cab layout.
</p>
<p>
   But there are certain button commands that PinballY "overloads", meaning
   that the same button has multiple functions, which depend on the context.
   For example, the Next and Previous keys are used to navigate through
   the game wheel UI, and they're also used to navigate through menus.
   One person on the forums pointed out that his personal sense of what
   "Next" and "Previous" should mean is reversed between the wheel UI and
   menus, which makes the way PinballY conflates the two functions feel
   wrong to him.
</p>
<p>
   Fortunately, Javascript gives us the power to change the meanings of
   button commands <i>according to context</i>.  Let's look at how we can
   reverse the meanings of the "Next" and "Previous" keys when we're in
   a menu, and leave them unchanged everywhere else.
</p>
<p>
   To make this work, we'll take advantage of three Javascript features:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>, which
   fires when the user presses a button assigned to a command function.
   This event represents an abstract command function rather than a raw
   keystroke, so it's perfect for our purposes here, since it'll adapt
   automatically to whatever physical keyboard keys are assigned to the
   Next and Previous functions.

   <li>The <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getUIMode">mainWindow.getUIMode()</a>
   method, which lets us determine if a menu is currently in progress.  This
   is how we can reverse the Next and Previous commands when we're in a menu,
   and leave them unchanged everywhere else.

   <li>The <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doButtonCommand">mainWindow.doButtonCommand()</a>
   method, which lets us simulate a button press from Javascript.  We'll
   use this to carry out the new, reversed menu command we want to execute
   when we detect that the user has pressed a menu navigation button.
</ul>

<p>
   The code needed is pretty simple.  We set up an event listener for the
   <b>commandbuttondown</b> event and check the UI mode to see if we're in
   a menu.  If so, we check the command being executed to see if it's a
   Next or Previous command.  If all of these things are true, execute
   the <i>opposite</i> command (if it's Next, we execute Previous, and
   if it's Previous, we execute Next), and finally cancel the event, so
   that the original Next or Previous is skipped in favor of our reversed
   version.  In any other case, we just return from the handler without
   doing anything more, letting the system go ahead with its
   normal handling.
</p>
<div class="code">
let reverseMenuMap = { "Next": "Prev", "Prev": "Next" };
mainWindow.on("commandbuttondown", ev => {
    if (mainWindow.getUIMode().mode == "menu") {
        let reverseCmd = reverseMenuMap[ev.command];
        if (reverseCmd) {
            mainWindow.doButtonCommand(reverseCmd, true, ev.repeat);
            ev.preventDefault();
        }
    }
});
</div>
