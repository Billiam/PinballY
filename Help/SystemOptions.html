<h1>Pinball Player System Setup</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you configure your pinball player systems, such as Visual
   Pinball and Future Pinball, for use with PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY tries to be as "system agnostic" as possible, so it tries to
   avoid hard-coded special handling for any one system.  Instead, it gives
   you a big collection of tunable options that you can tailor to each
   system.  The downside is that it makes the setup dialog pretty complex;
   it might look a little daunting when you first bring it up just because
   there are so many options.  But it's not as bad as it looks at first
   glance, because you can leave many of the options blank in most cases.
   PinballY will try to choose a suitable default for anything you leave
   blank.
</p>

<h2>Adding a new system</h2>

<p>
   To add a new system, click on the "Systems" item in the list on the
   left, then click the "Add a new system" button.  This will create a
   new system page that you can fill in with the system's details.
</p>

<h2>Migrating from PinballX</h2>

<p>
   If you've already set up PinballX on your system, and you've already
   gone through the process of setting up its list of tables and installing
   media packs, you can use all of those existing table lists and media files
   in PinballY without moving or copying any files.  All you have to do is
   make sure that the <b>System name</b> settings in your PinballY setup
   match those in your PinballX setup.  PinballX keys all of the folder
   locations for its table database and media files to the system name,
   so as the PinballY system name settings match your old PinballX system
   name settings, PinballY should be able to find your existing PinballX
   files.  You should also go to the "Folders" page and make sure that
   you've selected the "Auto" setting for both the main media folder and
   main table database folder; this will tell PinballY to use your existing
   PinballX folder trees.
</p>
<p>
   As long as you set the system name correctly for each system (to match
   the system name as it appeared in your PinballX setup), you can leave
   the "Media folder" and "Database folder" boxes blank.
</p>

<h2>Settings for all systems</h2>

<p>
   Some of the settings are handled the same way for all types of
   player systems:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>System name:</b> Enter a name of your choice here, as this
   is used mostly for display purposes in the user interface.  If
   you're migrating from PinballX, and you want to use the same
   media and table list files, you should make sure this matches
   the name used in your PinballX settings.

   <li><b>Enable:</b> Check this box to enable the system; un-check
   it to disable it.  Disabling a system prevents any of its games
   from appearing in the user interface, so it's effectively like
   deleting the system from your configuration entirely, except that
   it lets you keep the settings around in case you want to restore
   them in the future.

   <li><b>Media folder:</b>  This is the sub-folder (within the main
   PinballX or PinballY media folder tree) where the image, video,
   and sound files for this system's games are stored.  You can usually
   just leave this blank, in which case the System Name is used as
   the default folder name.

   <li><b>Database folder:</b>  This is the sub-folder (within the
   main PinballX or PinballY database folder tree) where the game
   listing files for this system are located.  You can usually just
   leave this blank, in which case the System Name is used as the
   default folder name.
</ul>

<h2>Recipes for the common systems</h2>

<p>
   The basic settings for the most common systems are listed below.
   Apart from the "System Name", "Media Folder", and "Database Folder",
   you should simply leave any fields not mentioned in the recipes blank.
   Set the System Name to a name of your choosing, but note that it should
   match the corresponding system name from your PinballX setup if you're
   migrating (see above).  The Media Folder and Database Folder boxes
   can be left blank, which uses the System Name as the default folder
   name in each case.
</p>

<h3>Visual Pinball 8/9</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Visual Pinball 9 or earlier<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> leave blank (see below)<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  /play -"[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]"<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .vpt<br>
</p>
<p>
   For the <b>Program EXE</b> box, if you leave it blank, PinballY will
   use the Visual Pinball executable that's assigned for <tt>.vpt</tt> files in
   the Windows registry.  This only works if you have only one version
   of VP installed, and you ran the VP SETUP program to set up the
   file associations in the registry.  If the .vpt file associations
   aren't set up, you'll have to enter the full path to the Visual
   Pinball .exe file; you can click the little folder icon button next
   to the Program EXE box to browse for the file.
</p>
<p>
   Many people keep multiple versions of VP 8-9 installed at the same
   time.  In this case, Windows only allows one of them to be associated
   with .vpt files, so the "leave it blank" advice will only work for
   that one version that's assigned in the registry.  For the other
   versions, you'll have to specify the version of VPinballXXX.exe
   to use.  For example, if you have both VP 9.2 and VP 9.9 installed
   (as many people do), follow this procedure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create two separate "system" pages, one for VP 9.2 and one for 9.9
   <li>In the VP 9.2 page, set the Program EXE box to VPinball921.exe
   (or whichever version is current)
   <li>In the VP 9.9 page, set the Program EXE box to VPinball995.exe
   (or whichever version is current)
</ul>
<p>
   You can repeat that procedure to create additional system pages
   for any other VP versions that you have installed.  Note that the
   default settings when you first install PinballY come with entries
   already filled in for VP 9.2, VP 9.9, and VP 10, so you probably
   won't have to create those yourself.  But you can create as many
   additional entries as you need.
</p>

<h3>Visual Pinball 10</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Visual Pinball 10<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> leave blank<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  /play -"[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]"<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .vpx<br>
</p>

<h3>Future Pinball</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Future Pinball<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> leave blank<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  [TABLEPATH] /open "[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]" /play /exit /arcaderender<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .fpt<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> [click playfield]<br>
   <b>DOF Prefix:</b> FP<br>
</p>

<h3>Future Pinball + BAM</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Future Pinball<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> BAM\FPLoader.exe<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  [TABLEPATH] /open "[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]" /play /exit /arcaderender<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> Future Pinball.exe<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .fpt<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> [click playfield]<br>
   <b>DOF Prefix:</b> FP<br>
</p>

<h3>Farsight's Pinball Arcade</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 238260<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> PinballArcade.exe<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> [pace 250] [pause 25] [click] [pause 5]
     up up right right right right right [click] [pause 5]
     up up left left left left left right [click] [pause 10]
     up left left left left left [click] [pause 5]
     [pace 1000] down [gridpos down right] [click] [pause 3] [click]<br>
</p>
<p>
   Note that the Program EXE setting should be literally <b>[STEAM]</b>, including
   the brackets.  I know that looks like one of those "substitute the real name
   here" formats you see in user manuals, but in this case it's not!  Just type
   in the literal text <b>[STEAM]</b>.
</p>
<p>
   The "Startup Keys" sequence is a huge mess, I know, but it seems to be the only
   way to automatically navigate to a particular game.  The key sequence is designed
   to step through Pinball Arcade's menu screens to get to the icon for the game,
   using the grid position configured for the game.  You can just copy and paste
   that whole sequence into the field.
</p>

<h3>Pinball FX2</h3>
<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 226980<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> Pinball FX2.exe<br>
</p>
<p>
   The Program EXE text should be entered literally as <b>[STEAM]</b>, including
   the brackets.  Don't substitute a file path or anything else; just write it
   literally like that.
</p>

<h2>Details on the settings</h2>

<p>
   The individual settings are explained below.  For most systems, you
   should be able to leave most of the fields blank.
</p>

<h3>System name</h3>
<p>
   This is the name that PinballY displays when referring to the system
   in the user interface, such as in the summary information box shown when
   the game is selected in the "wheel" menu.   The name is really only for
   display purposes, and doesn't have any special meaning to PinballY.
</p>

<h3>Delete System</h3>
<p>
   Click this button if you want to completely remove this system from
   your PinballY configuration.
</p>
<p>
   This button has no effect on the actual installed program
   system that the setting page refers to.  It won't uninstall your
   Visual Pinball player or anything crazy like that.  It just deletes
   the PinballY settings for the system.
</p>

<h3>Enable</h3>
<p>
   Check this box if you want to include the system's games in the
   "wheel" menu list.  If this box isn't checked, the system's games
   will be ignored. 
</p>
<p>
   The main reason for this box is that it lets you retain the default
   configuration settings for all of the pre-defined systems, even those
   that you don't currently have installed, just in case you ever want
   to install them in the future.  If you do install one of these systems
   in the future, you'll be able to use it in PinballY simply by
   checking the existing entry's Enable box, rather than having to enter all
   of the system's options anew.
</p>

<h3>Media folder</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the sub-folder for this system's "media" files:
   "wheel" icons, instruction card images, flyer pages, images and videos
   for the playfield and backglass, etc.
</p>
<p>
   This is always a sub-folder of the main PinballY media folder, which
   you can configure in the "Folders" page in the options dialog.  The
   folder name entered here shouldn't contain any path prefix or
   any "\" characters; it's just the name of the sub-folder.
</p>
<p>
   By default, each system's media folder name is simply the same as
   the system name.  Leave the folder name blank to use this default.
   If you're migrating from a PinballX installation, its media folders
   are always named the same as the corresponding systems.
</p>
<p>
   It's okay to have multiple systems sharing the same media folder.
   For example, if you have both Visual Pinball 9.2 and 9.9 installed,
   you might want to use a single "Visual Pinball" media folder for
   both systems.
</p>

<h3>Database folder</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the sub-folder for this system's "table database"
   files.  These are the XML files that list the games for the system
   and provide their bibliographic details (titles, manufacturers, etc).
</p>
<p>
   This is always a sub-folder of the main PinballY table database
   folder, which you can configure in the "Folders" page of the options
   dialog.  The folder name entered here shouldn't contain any path
   prefix or any "\" characters; it's just the name of the sub-folder.
</p>
<p>
   The default folder name is the same as the system name.  Leave
   the folder name blank to use this default.  If you're migrating
   from PinballX, its database folders are always named the same
   as the corresponding systems.
<p>
   Every system must have its own separate table database folder.
   Table database folders can't be shared.
</p>

<h3>System class</h3>

<p>
   We said above that we try to be "system agnostic", avoiding special
   handling for any one system, but a few systems are so ubiquitous that
   we do have some special recognition for them.  Specifically, Visual
   Pinball 8-9, Visual Pinball 10, Future Pinball, and Steam-based games.
   This doesn't mean that PinballY only supports those systems; it just
   means that PinballY has some special handling for those systems.
</p>
<p>
   You should select the option here that matches the system you're
   setting up.  If you don't see your system in the list, it's not
   a problem!  Just select "Other".
</p>
   

<h3>Table extension</h3>

<p>
   If the system uses separate table files, enter the filename
   extension for the files:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For Visual Pinball 9 or earlier, enter <tt>.vpt</tt>
   <li>For Visual Pinball X, enter <tt>.vpx</tt>
   <li>For Future Pinball, enter <tt>.fpt</tt>
</ul>

<p>
   Leave this blank if the system doesn't use table files (e.g.,
   any of the Steam-based systems).
</p>

<h3>DOF prefix</h3>

<p>
   This is a prefix code used for entries in the DOF configuration.  This
   is just a convention used in the DOF Config Tool, to distinguish
   the DOF settings for the same game written in different player
   systems.  For example, the Config Tool database includes listings
   for numerous re-creations of real games that were written
   for both Visual Pinball and Future Pinball.  Entering the
   correct prefix helps PinballY identify the right DOF settings to
   use depending on which game is selected in the "wheel".
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For Future Pinball, enter <tt>FP</tt>
   <li>For Pinball FX2, enter <tt>FX2</tt>
   <li>For Pinball FX3, enter <tt>FX3</tt>
</ul>

<p>
   Leave it blank in other cases.  The DOF Config Tool treats
   Visual Pinball games as the "default" system, so the different
   versions of VP never use a prefix.
</p>


<h3>Program EXE</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the application file (.exe) that PinballY
   will launch when you play a table using this system.  There are
   several choices here:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY will automatically launch
   the program that's associated in the Windows registry with the
   filename extension in the "Table Extension" box.  For example,
   if the extension is set to <b>.vpt</b>, the program associated
   with the .vpt extension would be launched.  This is the same
   program that Windows launches when you double-click on a file
   of that type in the Windows desktop.

   <p>
      Use this option whenever possible, since it's 
      the most future-proof choice.  If you use this approach,
      you won't have to worry about updating the PinballY settings
      the next time you update the program to a new version, or
      reinstall it in a different folder, since PinballY should
      be able to pick up the new location automatically from
      the registry.
   </p>

   <li><b>Specify the .exe name only:</b>  If you enter the .exe
   name without a path prefix (e.g., <tt>VPinball921.exe</tt> rather than
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinball921.exe</tt>), PinballY will look for the
   file in the folder containing the program that's associated with
   the file extension, but it will replace the registered program
   with the named program instead.
   <p>
      This option is especially good for Visual Pinball, since
      it's common to have multiple VP 8/9 versions installed on
      one pin cab at the same time.  All VP 8/9 versions
      use the .vpt file extension, but Windows only allows one
      program to be associated with a given extension, so they
      can't all use the fully automatic lookup of the "leave it
      blank" option.  This ".exe name only" option is the next best
      thing in this case.  As long as all of the different VP
      executables are installed in the same folder, this option
      lets you specify the specific VPinballXXX.exe program to
      run for each version, but still lets PinballY find the
      folder location based on the .vpt registry settings.  That
      at least makes the settings future-proof against
      reinstalling VP in a different folder.
   </p>

   <li><b>Specify a full path:</b>  If you don't have a Windows
   registry association for the file extension, you'll have to
   enter the full path for the program, as in <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinball921.exe</tt>.
   PinballY will simply launch this exact program file without
   consulting the registry or any other hidden information.
   Clicking on the folder button next to the box lets you browse for the
   program .exe file.

   <li><b>[STEAM]:</b>  For Steam-based programs like Farsight's
   Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2/FX3, you can enter the special
   name <b>[STEAM]</b> (exactly like that, including the brackets).
   This tells PinballY to find the Steam executable using Steam's
   installation records in the Windows registry.  As with the
   "leave it blank" option, this future-proofs the settings against
   updates to Steam or changes to its location.

</ul>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
   Enter the command-line parameters for the command here.  There's
   no general rule to how the parameters look; the parameters are
   entirely peculiar to the individual programs.  See the "recipes"
   section above for the parameter formats for the common systems.
</p>
<p>
   There are some special "substitution variables" that you can
   use in the parameters.  When the program is launched, these will
   be replaced with value specific to the game you're launching.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[TABLEPATH]</b>: the full path name to the table file for the
   game you're running.  For example, for a Visual Pinball game, this is
   the full path of the VP "Tables" folder, so it'll be something like
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILE]</b>: the filename of the table file for the
   game you're running, without any path prefix.  For example, for
   a Visual Pinball version of <i>Funhouse</i>, this might be something
   like <tt>funhouse_v2.vpt</tt>.
</ul>

<h3>Process name</h3>

<p>
   This is a weird special case needed mostly for Steam games (that is,
   games that are installed and launched via Valve's "Steam" system).
   Steam games use a two-step launch procedure where you run the
   STEAM.EXE application first, and that in turn runs the separate game
   program .exe (application) file.  In Windows terminology, each running
   .exe is a "process".  So when you run a Steam-based game like Farsight's
   Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2, you're really launching two processes:
   STEAM.EXE, and the actual game's .exe file.  This complicates things a
   bit for PinballY, because it needs to monitor each launched game process
   to determine when the game terminates, so that PinballY can take over
   when the game exits.  And the real complication is that STEAM.EXE itself
   terminates as soon as it launches the game .exe, so PinballY can't
   use STEAM.EXE as a proxy for whether the game is running; it has
   to monitor the separate process where the game's .exe is running.
</p>
<p>
   That's where the "Process name" setting comes in.  This lets you
   identify the name of the game process that Steam launches.
   This is simply the name of the game's .exe file, without any
   path prefix.  For example, for The Pinball Arcade, this is
   <tt>PinballArcade.exe</tt>.  
</p>


<h3>Startup keys</h3>
<p>
   This defines a sequence of keystrokes and mouse clicks to be sent to the
   launched program after it starts up.  There are three main uses for this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, to set focus on the right window after launch if needed.
   Future Pinball in particular needs a mouse click on its playfield
   window before it'll accept keyboard input.  You can do this with
   a simple <b>[click playfield]</b> sequence, which sends a mouse
   click to the middle of the playfield window.

   <li>Second, to click through any initial dialogs the
   game system displays at startup.  You can use a sequence like
   <b>enter enter</b> to send a couple of Enter key presses to the
   program to dismiss dialogs.

   <li>Third, to navigate any menus the game presents at startup.  This
   is needed for Farsight's Pinball Arcade, since it presents its own
   game selection menu.
</ul>

<p>
   See the "recipes" section above for the recommended settings
   for the various systems.  If you need to create a custom key
   sequence, here are the key names and special commands you
   can use:
</p>

      list above, as in <b>[gridpos comma period]</b> or, more likely, <b>[gridpos down right]</b></td></tr>

<h3>Table folder</h3>

<p>
   Enter the folder where this system's tables are located.
</p>
<p>
   If you're new to virtual pinball, it might seem puzzling and limiting that
   you have to specify a single folder here.  But that's the long-standing
   convention that's more or less forced by the design of Visual Pinball
   and Future Pinball, so it's assumed by most of the rest of the pin cab
   ecosystem.  It's not great for people who download a large number of
   tables and want to impose some kind of order on things, but you'll just
   make things unnecessary hard on yourself if you try to work around it.
</p>
<p>
   There are three formats for the entry here:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY assumes that tables are in the
   same folder as the program EXE if you leave this blank.

   <li><b>Enter a full folder path:</b>  If you enter a full, absolute
   folder path with drive letter (e.g., <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>),
   PinballY will simply use the exact path you enter.

   <li><b>Enter a "relative" folder name:</b>  If you enter a relative
   path with no drive letter prefix (e.g., <tt>Tables</tt>), PinballY
   will treat it as a sub-folder of the main folder containing the
   program EXE.
   <p>
      It's best to use this format when possible, because you won't
      have to update this setting if you should reinstall the player
      system in a different main program folder in the future.
      PinballY will automatically use whatever main program folder
      is current on each run.
   </p>
</ul>

<h3>NVRAM folder</h3>

<p>
   This is the folder where NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) files for the
   system's games are stored.  The NVRAM files are where the high
   score listings are stored, so this path needs to be set correctly
   for PinballY to be able to display high scores in the game list.
</p>
<p>
   This setting is only meaningful for Future Pinball and Visual Pinball,
   since PinballY can only read high scores from those types of systems.
</p>
<p>
   There are three ways to enter this setting:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY will use the standard NVRAM path
   for the system.  In the case of Visual Pinball, this is the NVRAM folder
   from your VPinMAME setup, as recorded in the registry.  For
   Future Pinball, this is the fpRAM sub-folder of the main Future
   Pinball program folder.  This is the best option in most cases,
   because you won't have to update it if you ever reinstall the
   player system in a new location.

   <li><b>Enter a full path:</b>  If you enter a full, absolute path
   with drive letter (e.g., <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinMAME\nvram</tt>),
   PinballY will use the folder exactly as specified.

   <li><b>Enter a relative path:</b>  If you enter only a sub-folder
   name with no path prefix (e.g., <tt>fpRAM</tt>), PinballY will
   look in that sub-folder of the system's main program folder.
</ul>


<h3>Run before</h3>
<p>
   This is a command to run just before launching the game.  Use the normal Windows
   command syntax, as though typing a command into the Windows+R "Run" box.
</p>
<p>
   You can put a special "flags" string at the very beginning of the command
   to control how the command is processed:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[NOWAIT]</b>: PinballY will execute the command and leave it running.
   If you don't specify this, PinballY will wait for the program to exit before
   proceeding to the next step.

   <li><b>[NOWAIT TERMINATE]</b>: PinballY will execute the command and leave
   it running, and will then explicitly terminate the running process as soon
   as the game exits.  Use this for a program that you want to leave running
   while the game runs, but <i>only</i> while the game runs.
</ul>
<p>
   There are also some "substitution variables" you can use anywhere within
   the command string:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[TABLEPATH]</b>: the full path name to the table file for the
   game you're running.  For example, for a Visual Pinball game, this is
   the full path of the VP "Tables" folder, so it'll be something like
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILE]</b>: the filename of the table file for the
   game you're running, without any path prefix.  For example, for
   a Visual Pinball version of <i>Funhouse</i>, this might be something
   like <tt>funhouse_v2.vpt</tt>.
</ul>


<h3>Run after</h3>

<p>
   This is a command to run just after a launched game exits.  This is just
   like the Run Before command above, except that it runs after the game
   terminates.  You can use the same flags and substitution variables as
   with Run Before, except that the TERMINATE option obviously doesn't
   make any sense with this one, since the game has already exited by
   the time this command is executed.
