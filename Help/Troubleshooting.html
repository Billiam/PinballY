<h1>Troubleshooting Tips</h1>

<p>
   This section is a collection of miscellaneous troubleshooting ideas
   to help diagnose and (hopefully) fix any problems you run into with PinballY.
</p>

<h2>General troubleshooting tips</h2>

Later in this section, we have a list of the most common problems that
people have run into in the past, with specific solutions, so check
through the list to see if you can find your particular issue.
However, if you can't find any information here on the specific issue
you're having, here are a few basic troubleshooting techniques that
can be applied to many sorts of problems.

<h3>Check the log file</h3>

<p>
   Many problems can be solved (or at least diagnosed) by checking PinballY's log file.  Every
   time you run PinballY, it creates a log file called <b>PinballY.log</b>
   in its main program folder.  As the program runs, it writes a bunch
   of miscellaneous status reports to the log file about what it's
   trying to do.  It also records technical details here about any Windows system
   errors that are encountered.  These sorts of technical details are usually omitted from on-screen
   error messages, since most people find the Windows error codes to be largely
   useless techno-gibberish, but once in a while it's helpful to know exactly
   what's going wrong under the covers.  So the log file tries to keep track
   of many of the technical details that are intentionally hidden from
   the on-screen UI, just in case they're needed.
</p>
<p>
   You've probably experienced situations where too much information
   is as bad as no information at all.  Too much can create a haystack
   that makes it hard to find the needle.  PinballY
   therefore lets you control the amount of information reported in
   the log file, via the <a href="LogFileOptions.html">Log File</a>
   page in the settings.  That page lets you filter the type of
   actions that PinballY reports in the log.  So before you consult
   the log file, you should go to the Log File options page and
   make sure that reporting is enabled for the subsystem that
   you're trying to troubleshoot.  You might also want to turn off
   logging for unrelated areas, to minimize the amount of other
   reports that you have to sift through.
</p>

<h3>Asking for help/reporting bugs</h3>
<p>
   If you can't find what you're looking for in this Troubleshooting section
   or elsewhere in the help files, try asking on the
   <a href="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=29">vpforums pin cab forum</a>.
   I regularly monitor that group, so I should be able to help if someone
   else doesn't get to your question first.
</p>
<p>
   For any problem that's pretty clearly a program bug, you can raise
   it on the forum, or you can file a bug report using the PinballY
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/issues">issue tracker</a>
   on GitHub.  Before filing a report, please read
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/wiki/How-to-write-a-good-bug-report">How to write a good bug report</a>.
   Following that advice will improve the chances that I can 
   find and fix the problem.
</p>

<h3>Resetting to factory settings</h3>

<p>
   If you feel like you've screwed up your settings beyond repair and
   you just want to reset everything to the standard defaults, it's
   usually <b>not</b> necessary to go to the trouble of reinstalling the whole program.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, all you have to do is delete the file <b>Settings.txt</b>,
   found in your main PinballY install folder.
</p>
<p>
   That file contains all of your option settings.  I've been careful to avoid the
   unfortunately common practice in other Windows software of scattering settings
   all over the registry and hidden files and so on.  PinballY keeps all user
   settings in that file.  Deleting it is usually enough to
   restore factory settings.  By the way, that file is a simple text file in
   human-readable format - it even has lots of comments explaining what's going on.
   Don't be afraid of opening it in Notepad if you want to see what's there.
</p>
   

<h2>Some common problems (and suggested solutions)</h2>

The topics below list some of the more common problems that I've heard
about, with suggestions for fixes or ways to gather more information.
Scan through the list to see if you can find anything that sounds
similar to any issues you're having.

<h3>PinballY doesn't have keyboard focus at system startup</h3>

<p>
   Symptom: You've set up PinballY to start up automatically with
   Windows, but each time you start up the system, PinballY ignores
   key presses.  You have to click on the PinballY window to give
   it keyboard focus.
</p>
<p>
   Causes: If you're using Windows 10, this is probably due to a change
   that Microsoft made in Task Scheduler (which PinballY uses for
   startup launching).  Microsoft changed Task Scheduler in Win 10 so
   that it doesn't give keyboard focus to the programs it launches.
   This might sound like a bug, and it kind of is for our purposes, but
   they did this intentionally because they consider auto-launch programs
   to be "background" tasks that shouldn't interrupt the user.  It would have
   been nice if they'd provided an option setting one way or the other
   on that, but they didn't.
</p>
<p>
   The only solution I've found to this issue is to make PinballY
   force keyboard focus into its own window at some time after it
   starts up.  In the Startup options dialog, try checking the box
   for "Force keyboard focus to PinballY at startup".  If that
   doesn't help, try increasing the delay time on the focus change.
</p>
<p>
   If all else fails, you can try <b>pressing and holding</b> the
   Exit Game button for about five seconds.  That's something you
   can do at any time to bring PinballY to the foreground and give
   it keyboard focus.
</p>
<p>
   If you're using a pre-Windows 10 system, Task Scheduler normally
   does give focus to newly launched tasks.  The most common thing that
   can prevent PinballY from having keyboard is another program
   "stealing" focus by starting up shortly after PinballY does.
   In most cases, the most recently launched program gets focus,
   so if something launches after PinballY during your system
   startup process, it usually gets focus by taking it away from
   PinballY.  To deal with this, try increasing the startup delay
   parameter in the Startup options dialog ("After logon, pause
   before starting PinballY").
</p>

<h3>PinballY loses keyboard focus after finishing a game</h3>
<p>
   Symptom: PinballY stops responding to button or key presses until you
   click the mouse in one of its windows.
</p>
<p>
   As I'm sure you know, Windows has concept called "keyboard focus" where
   it only sends keyboard input to one application at a time - usually the
   application with the active window.  This is usually seamless on a desktop
   PC, since you just use the mouse to choose the window you want to work
   with.  On a pin cab PC, though, you probably don't want to keep the mouse
   handy all the time.  So PinballY <i>tries</i> to manage focus as automatically
   as it can, by switching focus between itself and the running game as games
   start and exit.  But focus is always a point of contention on Windows,
   and it's possible for other applications (or Windows itself) to steal
   focus away, making PinballY stop responding to keyboard input.
</p>
<p>
   Starting with the Beta 18 release, there's a "mouseless" workaround if PinballY ever loses
   keyboard focus.  Simply <b>press and hold</b> the EXIT GAME button for about
   five seconds.  (The EXIT GAME button is usually the Escape key, but you can
   change this in the settings under <a href="ButtonOptions.html">Buttons</a>.)
   This should force PinballY back into the foreground and give it keyboard
   focus again.
</p>

<h3>Errors messages about missing DirectX components</h3>
<p>
   If PinballY shows an error message about missing DirectX components
   as soon as you launch the program, you probably need to upgrade to the
   latest version of Microsoft's DirectX.  This should never be necessary
   on Windows 8 or later, because those come with the necessary
   components pre-installed.  But if you're on Windows 7, you might need to update DirectX,
   <i>even if you already have DirectX 11 installed</i>,
   because Windows 7 originally came with an earlier version of DirectX 11
   that's not compatible with PinballY.  Update instructions can be
   found on the Microsoft website:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx</a>
</div>
   

<h3>Error message saying "MFPlat.DLL not found"</h3>

<p>
   This refers to a Windows system file that's normally installed by default
   as part of the operating system on Windows 7 through 10, but which Microsoft
   apparently changed to "optional" status in a newer Windows 10 update.
   Some people have had it disappear from their system as a result.  You
   can add it back by enabling the "Media Feature Pack" in the system settings:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Windows system control panel
   <li>Go to <b>Apps</b> &gt; <b>Apps and features</b> &gt; <b>Optional features</b> &gt; <b>Add a feature</b>
   <li>Find <b>Media Feature Pack</b> in the list
   <li>Click <b>Install</b>
   <li>According to the Microsoft support site, you'll need to reboot the computer
   to complete the installation, even though there might not be any message to this effect
</ul>


<h3>I'm running PinballY in Admin mode, and something's not working</h3>

<p>
  Simple answer: Don't run PinballY in Admin mode.  If you're running
  PinballY by right-clicking the program file and selecting "Run as Administrator",
  or you check the box for "Run as Administrator" in the .EXE file's property
  page, it's going to cause a bunch of problems, because the program
  isn't designed to run that way.  There <i>is</i> a way to run in Admin mode if necessary, but
  not by using "Run as Administrator".  See the help section on
  <a href="AdminMode.html">Administrator Mode</a> for the right approach.
</p>
<p>
   But more importantly, you ideally shouldn't need to use Admin
   Mode at all with PinballY.  There are two main reasons that most
   people think they need to use Admin Mode:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Because you read some advice on the forums or in a tutorial saying
   you should just run <i>everything</i> in Admin mode all the time.
   People mean well when they say that, but it's generally bad advice.
   See <a href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=software#AdminModeAllTheTime">
         Should I use "Run as Administrator" for everything?</a> in the
      <a href=http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/">Pinscape Build Guide</a>
      for an explanation.
   </p>
   <p>
      If this kind of blanket advice is the only reason you're using Admin Mode
      with PinballY (rather than an attempt to solve a specific problem), you should
      try undoing it and running everything without Admin Mode instead.
   </p>

   <li>Because some program you're launching from PinballY can only run in Admin Mode.  In
   the first place, I'd consider such a requirement in the other program
   to be a bug; see the Build Guide section linked above for why.
   But if you really can't live without the other program, and it really
   can't run any other way, go read the help section on <a href="AdminMode.html">Administrator Mode</a>.
   PinballY has the capability to launch Admin mode programs <i>without running
   in Admin Mode itself</i>.  Take advantage of that to give the other program
   its Admin Mode launch, without forcing everything else to run in Admin Mode too.
</ul>


<h3>PinballY isn't finding my tables</h3>

<p>
   The easiest way to figure out what's wrong when PinballY can't
   find some or all of your tables is to look at the <b>log file</b>.
   PinballY creates this file each time it runs, writing lots of extra
   technical details on what it's doing during the session.  This can
   usually pinpoint what's going wrong during table searches.
</p>
<p>
   To get detailed information on table searches:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog
   <li>Go to the Log File page
   <li>Make sure that the checkbox <b>Player system setup and table searches</b> is ticked
   <li>Save settings and exit the program
   <li>Run PinballY again, let it finish starting up, then exit
   <li>Use Notepad to view the file <b>PinballY.log</b> (in your main PinballY install folder)
</ul>
<p>
   Now read through the file for an account of where the program is
   looking for table files and what it's finding.
</p>
<p>
   For a detailed explanation of exactly where PinballY looks for tables,
   see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.
</p>


<h3>PinballY isn't showing media for my tables</h3>

<p>
   As with table search problems, the log file is the first place
   to look when PinballY isn't finding your media files.
   If you're having trouble getting most or all of your media
   files displayed, try this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog
   <li>Go to the Log File page
   <li>Make sure that the checkbox <b>Media file searches</b> is ticked
   <li>Save settings
   <li>Navigate to a game that isn't showing the right media files
   <li>Exit the program
   <li>Use Notepad to view the file <b>PinballY.log</b> (in your main PinballY install folder)
</ul>
<p>
   Now read through the file for an account of where the program is
   looking for media files and what it's finding.
</p>
<p>
   If you're having trouble with media for just a few specific games,
   try the built-in media list viewer:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Navigate to the game in question
   <li>Bring up the Operator Menu (press the digit zero "0" key, or whichever other key you've assigned)
   <li>Select <b>Show Media Files</b>
</ul>
<p>
   That will display details on where the system is looking for
   the game's media, the filename(s) it's looking for, and the
   full names and locations for all of the matching files.  You
   can check the file names that PinballY expects to find against
   the actual files on your disk, and likewise check the directory
   paths to make sure that you're placing the files where the
   program is looking for them.
</p>
<p>
   For a detailed explanation of exactly where PinballY looks for media,
   see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.
</p>

<h3>I have a VP X game, but I can only select VP 9 in the Edit Game Details box (not VP X!)</h3>

<p>
   Here's the situation:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>You have some Visual Pinball X  (.vpx) game
   <li>When you try to launch the game, PinballY keeps launching VP 9 instead of VP X
   <li>When you go the Edit Game Details box to try to fix this,
   the "System" drop list only lets you choose from Visual Pinball 9 or Visual Pinball 9.2,
   <b>not</b> VP X as it should be
</ul>
<p>
   The most likely problem (and solution) is described in the topic
   <b>PinballY thinks my Visual Pinball X tables are Visual Pinball 9 tables</b>
   below.
</p>

<h3>PinballY thinks my Visual Pinball <u>X</u> tables are Visual Pinball <u>9</u> tables</h3>

<p>
   Did you just migrate to PinballY from PinballX?  And did you tell
   PinballY to use the table databases and media files you already
   had set up for PinballX?  If so, here's what's probably wrong:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   Your PinballX table database folder for Visual PinballX was probably
   called <b>Visual Pinball</b>
</div>
<p>
   That might seem perfectly natural, especially if you only started
   playing around with VP games recently and mostly use VP X rather
   than the older VP 9 games.  But PinballY doesn't know that!
   PinballY is set up by default to work with <i>both</i> VP 9 and
   VP X.  In fact, it's set up to work with multiple versions of
   VP 9, since there are several sub-versions of VP 9 whose games
   require those specific versions (like VP 9.2 and "PhysMod 5").
   To deal with this, the default settings in PinballY (the ones you
   get when you first install the program) use the following database
   folder names:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Visual Pinball 9's database folder is <b>Visual Pinball</b>
   <li>Visual Pinball 9.2's database folder is <b>Visual Pinball 9.2</b>
   <li>Visual Pinball X's database folder is <b>Visual Pinball X</b>
</ul>

<p>
   See the problem?  When PinballY loads the system databases, it
   looks at the settings, and it sees that the database folder for
   Visual Pinball 9 is called <b>Visual Pinball</b>, so it looks
   at the tables listed there.  But you put all of your VP X games
   there when you were using PinballX.  So PinballY thinks that
   your VP X games are actually VP 9 games.
      
<p>
   Here's the solution:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog
   <li>Open the system page for Visual Pinball 9
   <li>Change the database folder to <b>Visual Pinball 9</b>
   <li>Open the system page for Visual Pinball X
   <li>Change the database folder to <b>Visual Pinball</b>
</ul>
<p>
   PinballY should now be in sync with your old PinballX settings.  There's
   no need to move or rename any of the PinballX files.  It's just a matter
   of changing the PinballY settings to match the folder names you're using.
</p>


<h3>The capture screen location is wrong for the playfield/backglass/other window</h3>

<p>
   Symptom: When you use the "Capture" command to capture screenshots
   or videos of the running game, the captured videos grab the wrong
   screen area for one or more windows.  They're not aligned with
   the actual Visual Pinball screen area, so they're clipped or
   just the wrong areas entirely.
</p>
<p>
   Cause: PinballY doesn't actually know where Visual Pinball's
   windows are.  It doesn't want to make assumptions about which
   windows go where, because that would require too much hard-coded
   knowledge of particular pinball programs, which would make the
   Capture feature less likely to work for new pinball programs
   (and would also make it likely to stop working every time
   the other programs are updated).
</p>
<p>
   Instead, PinballY simply captures the screen area of the <b>PinballY windows</b>.
   The assumption is that you have a particular monitor area that you <i>always</i>
   use for your playfield, <i>in every player program</i>.  And another area
   that you <i>always</i> use for your backglass, etc.  And since you're
   using those areas in every pinball program, PinballY assumes you're going
   to use those exact same areas for the corresponding PinballY windows.
   That makes the Capture feature's choice of screen locations super easy:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The playfield video/image is captured from the screen area of the <b>PinballY playfield window</b>
   <li>The backglass video/image is captured from the screen area of the <b>PinballY backglass window</b>
   <li>And so on
</ul>
<p>
   So if PinballY is capturing the wrong area for a particular player program,
   simply move the corresponding PinballY window into the right area before
   you run the capture.
</p>
<p>
   We chose this scheme because the fixed screen locations are practically
   a given on a pin cab.  A pin cab usually has a whole monitor devoted
   to each function, so naturally you're going to set up both PinballY
   and every pinball program the same way, to use those exact monitors.
   This is less of a given for desktop users, though, so you might have
   to juggle windows around a little bit during capture if you don't
   always run every pinball program with the exact same window layout.
</p>

<h3>When I run capture, the backglass/topper/other window isn't offered as an option</h3>

<p>
   Symptom: When you run the capture command, the list of available media
   types doesn't include the backglass window, or doesn't include some
   other window you want to include.
</p>
<p>
   Cause: The window you want to capture <b>must be open in PinballY</b> when
   you run the capture command.  As described in the topic above about screen locations
   for capture, PinballY figures the screen location for each window type
   according to the corresponding <b>PinballY window's</b> location.
   In order to have a location at all, the window has to be open!
   So the list of available media types only includes the windows
   that you currently have open.
</p>
<p>
   To bring up any of the windows that you've hidden, simply right-click
   in the main PinballY playfield window, and select <b>Show Backglass</b>
   or <b>Show Topper</b>, etc., for whichever window you want to bring back
   from the invisible.  Once you make the window visible, it should show
   up in the list of available media types the next time you run a
   capture.
</p>

<h3>PinballY won't save/restore my backglass window position</h3>

<p>
   Symptom:  Each time you start a new PinballY session, the backglass
   window (or one of the other windows) opens at the wrong position.
   It won't stay where you left it at the end of the last session.
</p>
<p>
   The usual cause of this problem is that you're running some other
   program that's changing the screen resolution or monitor layout
   between sessions.  For example, you might be using a program that
   rotates your monitors or changes the desktop resolution each time
   you run certain programs, or you might be using a remote access
   program that changes the screen resolution during remote sessions.
</p>
<p>
   The reason PinballY moves the windows around in these situations
   is that it normally checks all of the restored window positions to
   make sure they're in the visible desktop area at program startup.
   If any windows are outside of the visible area, PinballY moves
   them into the visible area.  This is intended to help with rare
   cases where you <i>permanently</i> change the desktop layout at
   the hardware level, such as when you add a new monitor or replace an
   old one with a new one of a different size.  But it can be a nuisance
   if you <i>routinely</i> change your desktop layout at the software level,
   such as if you need to change the layout every time you run a
   certain application.
</p>
<p>
   The easy fix that usually works is to tell PinballY to stop
   forcing windows into the visible desktop area at the start of
   every session:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog in PinballY
   <li>Go to the <b>Startup</b> section
   <li><b>Un-check</b> the box <b>Make sure all windows are positioned within the
      visible desktop area</b>
</ul>

<p>
   If that still doesn't help, and the window that's not "sticking"
   to its proper position is in full-screen mode, there's a second
   option setting that might help:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog in PinballY
   <li>Go to the <b>Startup</b> section
   <li>Under <b>Restore full-screen windows based on:</b>, select
   <b>Exact saved pixel coordinates</b>
</ul>
<p>
   If none of that helps, try turning on logging for <b>Window layout setup</b>
   (in the Log File section of the settings dialog).  The next time you
   encounter the problem with a saved window position, exit PinballY and
   check the log file for details about window layout setup.  That should
   explain why PinballY is making the decisions it's making about window
   placement, which hopefully will suggest an appropriate solution.
</p>


<h3>The Windows taskbar pops up every time a VP X game finishes</h3>

<p>Try this:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the VP X editor (without a game running)
   <li>Select <b>Video/Graphics Options</b> from the Preferences menu
   <li><b>Un-check</b> the box for <b>Disable Desktop Composition</b>
   (in the Fullscreen section)
</ul>
<p>
   What's going on: this checkbox makes VP ask Windows to turn off
   the feature inside Windows that lets it draw partially transparent
   transparent window frames and elements.  VP lets you disable this
   because it can slow down your video card slightly; if you have a
   low-end video card, enabling composition might slow down your
   video card enough to cause hiccups in VP, so disabling it might
   make VP run more smoothly.  The snag is that Windows automatically
   turns composition back on when VP exits, which has the annoying side
   effect of redrawing everything on the screen, which has the
   even more annoying side effect of bringing the taskbar to the
   foreground even if it was hidden. 
</p>
<p>
   PinballY can't do much about that, since Windows has ultimate
   control over what's on the screen.  This is one of those situations
   where Windows asserts its authority and overrides whatever the
   applications would prefer.  So the best way to avoid the problem
   is to tell VP not to make this change in the first place, so that Windows
   doesn't feel the need to redo the whole screen layout every time VP exits.
</p>
<p>
   If you really need to disable desktop composition in VP for
   performance reasons, you might have to live with the momentary
   taskbar appearance after game sessions.  It's possible to disable
   desktop composition across your whole system in the Windows settings, so that
   Windows isn't constantly switching it on and off when switching
   programs - but doing so might prevent PinballY from displaying
   its graphics properly.  So I don't recommend that.

   Note that if you have Windows 8 or later, you should definitely
   un-check the option in VP, because it doesn't do anything anyway!
   Microsoft made desktop composition a core feature of the operating
   system starting in Windows 8, so applications can't disable it
   even if they try.  VP will still try if you un-check the box,
   so un-checking the box might still cause the glitchy taskbar redrawing,
   but it won't have any performance benefit since Windows will otherwise
   ignore the attempt.

<h3>Menu text (or other text) is missing</h3>
<p>
   Symptom: When you press the Start button to bring up a menu, you
   just see a blank gray box with a blue highlight line, with no text
   anywhere to be seen.  The game titles shown in the game wheel (for
   games without icon images) might also be missing.
</p>
<p>
   If you're on Windows 7, this can be caused by some system video option
   settings.  Check the following two settings:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Windows control panel, go to the <b>Appearance and Personalization</b>
   section, and click "change the theme".  Make sure that one of the <b>Aero themes</b>
   is selected.

   <li>Still in the Windows control panel, go to the <b>Performance Information and Tools</b> section.
   Select the <b>Visual Effects</b> tab.
   <ul>
      <li>If you're already using <b>Custom</b>, make sure <b>Smooth edges of screen fonts</b> is checked

      <li>If you've selected <b>Adjust to best performance</b>, switch to <b>Custom</b>,
      and check the checkbox labeled <b>Smooth edges of screen fonts</b>
   </ul>
</ul>

<p>
   The key appears to be that font-smoothing option.  Apparently the Windows drawing
   functions that PinballY uses to construct the menu and other text graphics depend
   upon it.
</p>
<p>
   Note that some Windows 7 users intentionally disable the Aero theme because
   of its performance impact, especially if you have a lower-end video card.
   If you need to disable Aero for acceptable game performance, you might be able
   to disable it on a game-by-game basis, instead of disabling it for the whole system.
   Look in the game player programs you're using for option settings.  For example,
   Visual Pinball has an option in its <b>Video/Graphics Options</b> preference
   dialog called <b>Enable desktop composition</b>, which you can un-check to
   disable the Aero elements that affect performance.

<h3>PinballY keeps taking control a few seconds after I launch a game</h3>
<p>
   Symptom: Shortly after launching a game, PinballY brings itself
   back to the foreground, as though the game had already ended, even though
   the game only just started!
</p>
<p>
   If the game in question is a commercial game based on Steam, or
   it's Future Pinball with BAM, or it uses any other "two-stage" launch
   procedure, the problem might be in the option settings for the system.
</p>
<p>
   Steam games and FP BAM games use a complicated launch procedure where
   you launch one .EXE program, which then launches another .EXE program
   that represents the actual game.  For example, with Pinball FX3, PinballY
   has to launch the main Steam program file <b>Steam.exe</b> to get the ball rolling (as it
   were), but Steam.exe then launches a separate program called <b>Pinball FX2.exe</b>.
   Once that's going, Steam.exe quits and lets Pinball FX2.exe take over.
</p>
<p>
   The thing that makes this tricky for PinballY is that PinballY wants to
   monitor the launched game program, so that it can figure out when the
   game is over and it's appropriate for PinballY to take over the screen
   again.  With Steam (and BAM, and probably a few others), the program
   that PinballY actually launches exits after a few seconds, even though
   the game is still running in that second process.  But PinballY doesn't
   just magically know that!  When it sees the directly launched program
   quit, it thinks that the game is over and it's time to take over again.
</p>
<p>
   The solution is to explicitly tell PinballY about this
   two-stage launch setup.  PinballY has a special provision for this,
   because it's pretty common, but PinballY can't figure it out on its
   own; you have to tell it.  The way to do this is to go to the settings
   dialog, navigate to the page for the system in question, and enter
   the "final" program name in the <b>Process Name</b> box.  The "final"
   program is the one that's actually left running after the multi-stage
   launch has finished and the game is really going.
</p>
<p>
   The name you enter in the Process Name box must <b>not</b> include
   a path, but must <b>include</b> the .EXE suffix.  For Pinball FX3,
   for example, you'd enter <b>Pinball FX3.exe</b>.
