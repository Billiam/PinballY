<h1>Troubleshooting Tips</h1>

<p>
   This section is a collection of tips for dealing with some of the
   problems that other people have run into.  
</p>

<h2>Asking for help/reporting bugs</h2>
<p>
   If you can't find what you're looking for in this Troubleshooting section
   or elsewhere in the help files, try asking on the
   <a href="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showforum=29">vpforums pin cab forum</a>.
   I regularly monitor that group, so I should be able to help if someone
   else doesn't get to your question first.
</p>
<p>
   For any problem that's pretty clearly a program bug, you can raise
   it on the forum, or you can file a bug report using the PinballY
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/issues">issue tracker</a>
   on GitHub.  Before filing a report, please read
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/wiki/How-to-write-a-good-bug-report">How to write a good bug report</a>.
   Following that advice will improve the chances that I can 
   find and fix the problem.

<h2>PinballY isn't finding my tables</h2>

<p>
   The easiest way to figure out what's wrong when PinballY can't
   find some or all of your tables is to look at the <b>log file</b>.
   PinballY creates this file each time it runs, writing lots of extra
   technical details on what it's doing during the session.  This can
   usually pinpoint what's going wrong during table searches.
</p>
<p>
   To get detailed information on table searches:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog
   <li>Go to the Log File page
   <li>Make sure that the checkbox <b>Player system setup and table searches</b> is ticked
   <li>Save settings and exit the program
   <li>Run PinballY again, let it finish starting up, then exit
   <li>Use Notepad to view the file <b>PinballY.log</b> (in your main PinballY install folder)
</ul>
<p>
   Now read through the file for an account of where the program is
   looking for table files and what it's finding.
</p>
<p>

   see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.

<h2>PinballY isn't showing media for my tables</h2>

<p>
   As with table search problems, the log file is the first place
   to look when PinballY isn't finding your media files.
   If you're having trouble getting most or all of your media
   files displayed, try this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the Settings dialog
   <li>Go to the Log File page
   <li>Make sure that the checkbox <b>Media file searches</b> is ticked
   <li>Save settings
   <li>Navigate to a game that isn't showing the right media files
   <li>Exit the program
   <li>Use Notepad to view the file <b>PinballY.log</b> (in your main PinballY install folder)
</ul>
<p>
   Now read through the file for an account of where the program is
   looking for media files and what it's finding.
</p>
<p>
   If you're having trouble with media for just a few specific games,
   try the built-in media list viewer:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Navigate to the game in question
   <li>Bring up the Operator Menu (press the digit zero "0" key, or whichever other key you've assigned)
   <li>Select <b>Show Media Files</b>
</ul>
<p>
   That will display details on where the system is looking for
   the game's media, the filename(s) it's looking for, and the
   full names and locations for all of the matching files.  You
   can check the file names that PinballY expects to find against
   the actual files on your disk, and likewise check the directory
   paths to make sure that you're placing the files where the
   program is looking for them.
</p>
<p>
   For a detailed explanation of exactly where PinballY looks for media,
   see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.

<h2>The Windows taskbar pops up every time a VP X game finishes</h2>

<p>Try this:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the VP X editor (without a game running)
   <li>Select <b>Video/Graphics Options</b> from the Preferences menu
   <li><b>Un-check</b> the box for <b>Disable Desktop Composition</b>
   (in the Fullscreen section)
</ul>
<p>
   What's going on: this checkbox makes VP ask Windows to turn off
   the feature inside Windows that lets it draw partially transparent
   transparent window frames and elements.  VP lets you disable this
   because it can slow down your video card slightly; if you have a
   low-end video card, disabling composition might let VP run more
   smoothly.  If VP turns composition off, though, Windows will always
   turn it back on when VP exits.  That makes the Windows desktop want
   to redraw everything, which can cause the taskbar to pop to the
   foreground.
</p>
<p>
   If you really need to disable desktop composition:  If you have
   low-end video card that won't perform well enough with composition
   enabled, it's better to disable it <b>globally</b> across your whole system,
   so that Windows and VP aren't constantly fighting over whether it's
   on or off.  In the Windows control panel, select System and Security,
   then System, then Advanced System Settings.  Select the Advanced
   tab.  Click the Settings button.  In the Performance section, find
   "Enable desktop composition", and un-check the box.
</p>

<p>
   Note that Microsoft doesn't let applications disable Aero on
   any Windows version after Windows 7, so the checkbox doesn't
   actually accomplish anything on Windows 8 or later.
