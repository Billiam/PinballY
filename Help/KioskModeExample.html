<h1>Kiosk Mode</h1>

<p>
   I was asked recently if there was a way to get rid of all of
   the filter options on the main menu, so that the system was
   locked in "All Games" mode.  The person asking was getting
   ready to take his pin cab to a pinball expo to put on the
   show floor, so he wanted to lock things down a bit so that
   random users at the show wouldn't mess things up or confuse
   themselves by hiding a bunch of the games behind a filter.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY doesn't have a specific option setting for this kind
   of "kiosk mode" restriction, but it's the sort of thing that's
   easy to implement in Javascript, since Javascript lets you
   modify any of the system menus to your exact liking.  In this
   case, you can use this capability to remove a bunch of the
   standard menu options to restrict the functions that users
   can access.
</p>

<h2>Enabling kiosk mode</h2>
<p>
   Removing menu items is pretty simple by itself, so for the
   sake of a more complete example, let's throw in one more
   feature: let's add a menu item that lets you switch in and
   out of Kiosk mode through the UI.
</p>
<p>
   Obviously, we can't let ordinary users access this special
   new Kiosk Mode command, as that would defeat the whole
   purpose.  Fortunately, there's an obvious place to put any
   menu commands that we want to restrict to the pin cab
   priesthood, namely the Operator Menu.  In a real pin cab
   setup, the Operator Menu is normally accessed from the
   service panel buttons inside the coin door.  That was
   intentionally designed for exactly this situation, since
   it naturally restricts access to the Operator Menu to those
   who have the key to the coin door.  Perfect for an expo
   setup.
</p>
<p>
   If you've looked at the other worked examples, you know
   the process for adding a new command to a menu by now:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create a command ID to represent the new action
   <li>Set up a menu event listener to add the custom command
   to the desired menu (in this case, the Operator Menu)
   <li>Write a command event listener to carry out the command
</ul>

<p>
   Here's the code to do all of that.
</p>

<div class="code">
// create our custom command ID
let kioskModeCommand = command.allocate("ToggleKioskMode");

// our custom option name for the settings file
let kioskModeKey = "custom.kioskMode";

// are we currently in Kiosk Mode?
let inKioskMode = optionSettings.getBool(kioskModeKey, false);

// add the command to the Operator Menu each time it's displayed
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (ev.id == "operator") {
        ev.addMenuItem(command.Options, {
            title: "Kiosk Mode",
            cmd: kioskModeCommand,
            checked: inKioskMode
        });
    }
});

// Handle the command when it's selected
mainWindow.on("command", ev => {
    if (ev.id == kioskModeCommand) {
        // update the global variable that remembers the mode
        inKioskMode = !inKioskMode;

        // save it in the settings file, so that it'll persist across sessions
        optionSettings.set(kioskModeKey, inKioskMode);

        // if we're entering Kiosk Mode, make sure the All Games
        // filter is selected, since we won't be able to change
        // filters while this mode is active
        if (inKioskMode)
            gameList.setCurFilter("All");
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   That should mostly look familiar if you've gone over the other
   examples that set up custom menu commands.  There are a couple
   of special extra things we're doing in this example, though:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, we're use the settings
   file to remember the Kiosk Mode setting.  This is pretty easy,
   since all we have to do is remember a boolean (true/false) value
   that answers the question "are we in Kiosk Mode?".  To do this
   we use the <a href="OptionSettingsObject.html">optionSettings</a>
   system object.  The name of the settings variable is nothing
   special; we used the "custom" prefix purely to reduce the chances
   that it'll ever conflict with a variable name that the system
   uses.

   <li>Second, we're using the gameList.setCurFilter() method to
   switch to the All Games filter whenever we enter Kiosk Mode.
   That seems important given that Kiosk Mode will prevent us
   from accessing any filter commands from the UI, meaning we
   won't be able to switch back to All Games mode manually once
   Kiosk Mode is active.  On the other hand, you might actually
   want the option to lock the system into whichever filter
   was already selected - that could be useful for setting
   up something like a parental filter.   In that case, you
   can just remove the setCurFilter() call.

</ul>

<h2>Remove the filter menus</h2>

<p>
   Now we come to the original question, which is how to get rid
   of the filter menu command in the main menu.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, removing a command from a menu works like this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Listen for the "menuopen" event
   <li>Check the menu ID being opened, and if it's the menu we want to modify,
   find and remove the command we want to exclude
</ul>
<p>
   This case is a little different, in that the filters don't have
   pre-determined IDs.  The system assigns command IDs to the filters
   at the start of each session instead.
</p>
<p>
   All of that makes it seem a little trickier to find the filter
   commands.  But the system helps us out here by grouping the
   filter commands into a range of commands,
   <a href="Commands.html#FilterFirst">command.FilterFirst</a> to
   <a href="Commands.html#FilterLast">command.FilterLast</a>.
   For the sake of completeness, we should also remove any custom
   user filters you've added through other Javascript modules;
   those will be in the range
   <a href="Commands.html#UserFilterFirst">command.UserFilterFirst</a> to
   <a href="Commands.html#UserFilterLast">command.UserFilterLast</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There's also the matter of
  "filter groups", where the command in the main menu takes you
  to a sub-menu with the individual filters.  For example,
  "Filter by Manufacturer" takes you to a separate menu showing
  the manufacturer filters.  For these, the system does give us
  a set of fixed constants:
  <a href="Commands.html#FilterByAdded">command.FilterByAdded</a>,
  <a href="Commands.html#FilterByCategory">command.FilterByCategory</a>,
  and so on.  It's a little brittle to rely on a fixed set like
  that, though, since we'd have to remember to change our
  Javascript code every time PinballY gets a new built-in
  filter group.  So the better way to do this is to take
  advantage of the ability to get a list of all of the filters
  via <a href="GameList.html#getAllFilters">gameList.getAllFilters()</a>,
  and use that to come up with a set of all of the group IDs.
</p>
<p>
   We can actually simplify things a bit by using the group
   command approach for the filter commands as well, so that
   we just have to look in one place to see if a given command
   is any sort of filter command.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    // restrict the main menu when we're in Kiosk Mode
    if (inKioskMode && ev.id == "main") {
        // compile a map of all of the filter commands and group commands
        let filterCommands = new Map();
        gameList.getAllFilters().forEach(f => {
            filterCommands.set(f.cmd, true);
            if (f.groupCmd)
                filterCommands.set(f.groupCmd, true);
        });

        // remove all commands that relate to filters or filter groups
        ev.items = ev.items.filter(m => !filterCommands.get(m.cmd));

        // tidy up the menu by removing any empty groups left over
        ev.tidyMenu();
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   Note that it's just a happy (or perhaps confusing) coincidence
   that we're using the Javascript array method named "filter()" to
   remove the filter menu items!  That's a standard Javascript method
   that takes a subset of an array according to a test condition -
   in this case, keeping only commands that aren't in the list of
   filter commands.
</p>
<p>
   The call to <a href="MenuEvent.html#tidyMenu">tidyMenu()</a>
   is there to handle the likely situation that we'll remove all
   of the items between a pair of separator bars that the system
   used to group the filter commands visually in the menu.  The
   tidyMenu() method looks for adjacent separator bars, which we
   can identify by their empty title string, and removes the first
   one when it finds a pair of them packed together with nothing
   in between.  This gets rid of any unsightly empty groups that
   are left over after we edit the menu, making it look presentable
   again.
</p>
   

<h2>Disable the Exit menu</h2>

<p>
   There's one more little detail we'll want to take care of.
   When in Kiosk Mode, we'll also want to disable the Exit menu,
   so that users won't be able to quit out of PinballY and mess
   around with your Windows desktop.  To do that, we can intercept
   the menu event that occurs when the Exit menu is about to be
   opened, and cancel the whole thing.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (inKioskMode && ev.id == "exit")
        ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>
<p>
   Note that you can also disable the Exit menu manually
   from the <a href="MenuOptions.html">Menu Options</a> page
   of the Settings dialog.  But I think it's a little tidier
   to include it in the Kiosk Mode option like this, since
   this way, you won't have to remember to change
   that separate setting each time you switch modes.  The
   custom Kiosk Mode command we placed on the operator menu
   takes care of it automatically.
</p>
<p>
   And one more thing!  Now that we've disabled the normal
   Exit menu, it would be nice to have a way for the operator
   to exit the program, by adding a command to the Operator
   Menu.  We just need to add an item that activates the
   built-in Quit command.  Let's add it to the end of the
   menu, just before the standard "Cancel" item at the bottom.
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("menuopen", ev => {
    if (inKioskMode && ev.id == "operator") {
        ev.addMenuItem(command.MenuReturn, { title: "Exit PinballY", cmd: command.Quit });
    }
});
</div>
