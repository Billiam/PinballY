<h1>OLE Automation Objects</h1>

<p>
   OLE Automation is a Windows feature that lets scripting languages
   access system functions and features in other applications.  This is also known
   as "Scripting Objects", but that's a vague term that can mean other
   things as well.  Automation was created originally for the Visual Basic
   language, and is most often used in VB.   Windows Power Users will be
   familiar with this from working with Visual Basic scripts in programs
   like Excel, Word, or WScript.  If you've done any work creating Visual
   Pinball tables, you might have used automation objects in VP's Visual Basic
   scripts.
</p>
<p>
   In Javascript, you create an OLE scripting object like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
let fs = createAutomationObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
</div>
<p>
   If you're a Visual Basic user, it might be helpful if we mention
   that this is the equivalent of VB's CreateObject() function.
</p>

<p>
   The object name in quotes is the "class name" of the object you wish
   to create.  This isn't defined by Javascript; it's defined by whatever
   application or system facility provides the automation object.  Windows
   provides a set of pre-installed "Scripting" objects, including
   "Scripting.FileSystemObject", which provides functions to access files
   and folders on the local hard disks.  Many other objects come from
   separate applications, such as Excel or Word. 
</p>
<p>
   If the named class is installed on your system, createAutomationObject()
   returns a Javascript object that provides the set of methods and properties
   defined by the system object.  You can now simply call methods on the
   returned object to access the system features provided by the object.
</p>
<div class="code">
// list the files in the Windows folder
for (let file of fs.GetSpecialFolder(0).Files)
    console.log(file.Name);
</div>

<p>
   One common Windows OLE object that you <i>shouldn't</i> use is
   MSXML.XMLHTTP (or any of its several versions).  You should use PinballY's
   <a href="HttpRequest.html">HttpRequest</a> instead, as it has provisions
   for asynchronous event handling that can't be easily reproduced with
   the generic Automation facility.
</p>

<h2>"Variant" arguments</h2>

<p>
   Many Automation objects work in terms of "Variant" variables, which
   is a special object formatted the same way that Visual Basic represents
   its variable values.  (Microsoft originally designed Automation around
   Visual Basic's needs, so the whole system is very VB-centric.)  When
   you call a method on an automation object, any Javascript arguments
   you pass to slots expecting Variant values have to be converted to
   Variant before being passed to the external object.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript will perform the conversion to Variant automatically if you
   use regular Javascript values as arguments, so in most cases you can just
   call methods on these objects without worrying about special data types.
</p>
<p>
   There's a snag, though.  The automatic conversion can't always figure out
   which type the callee expects, so it always uses a standard conversion
   from each Javascript type to a suitable corresponding Variant type.  For
   example, if you  pass a Javascript number value as an argument, it will
   always be converted to a Variant "double", which is the VB equivalent of
   a Javascript number.  The snag is that some automation methods are picky
   about the exact types they receive as arguments, and will return an
   error if you pass the "default" type used in the standard conversion
   from Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   In such cases, you can solve the mismatch by explicitly creating your
   own Variant variable, and setting it to the expected type.  You can do
   this as follows:
</p>
<div class="code">
// create a Variant variable and set its "short int" value
let v = new Variant();
v.iVal = 7;

// now pass "short int" 7 to an automation method
let x = createAutomationObject("Example.Object");
x.RequiresShortInt(v);
</div>


<p>
   See <a href="Variant.html">Variants</a> for details on the special
   Variant type.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   Some OLE Automation objects have "properties".  These work a lot
   like Javascript properties: they're named slots in the object where
   you can read and/or write values.  The syntax in Javascript for
   operating on Automation object properties <i>usually</i> looks exactly
   like the normal syntax for accessing properties of Javascript objects.
   For example, the standard Windows scripting object <tt>Scripting.Dictionary</tt>
   has a property called <tt>CompareMode</tt> that lets you specify
   how values are compared:
</p>
<div class="code">
let dict = createAutomationObject("Scripting.Dictionary");
dict.CompareMode = 1;
</div>
<p>
   Okay, that's straightforward enough, but why did we say you "usually"
   use the normal Javascript syntax?  That's because there are cases
   where you can't use the normal syntax.  Specifically, you can't use
   the normal assignment syntax for <i>properties with arguments</i>.
</p>
<p>
   What's a "property with arguments"?  It's a property that doesn't
   represent just a single value, but represents multiple values, indexed
   by one or more additional arguments.  Conceptually, it's like an array
   variable.  For example, the <tt>Scripting.Dictionary</tt> object has a property
   called <tt>Item</tt> that acts like an array of values that can be
   indexed by numbers, strings, dates, or anything else.  In keeping
   with the conceptual similarity to arrays, Visual Basic lets you
   access these properties with syntax exactly like array variables:
</p>
<div class="code">
' NOTE!  This is a VISUAL BASIC example, NOT Javascript!
' "Item" is a property of the Scripting.Dictionary object
' that can take arguments, so we access it like an array.
dict.Item("red") = 72
MsgBox "The 'red' value is " + dict.Item("red")
</div>
<p>
   Now, given that these sorts of properties are meant to resemble arrays
   conceptually, and given that you access them in Visual Basic exactly
   as though they were arrays, it might seem like the logical translation
   to Javascript would be treat them as arrays there as well, by changing
   the Visual Basic parentheses to Javascript square brackets.  Unfortunately,
   that won't work:
</p>
<div class="code">
// Javascript equivalent of the above?  NO!  This won't work!!!
dict.Item["red"] = 72;   // WRONG!!!
alert("The 'red' value is " + dict.Item["red"]);  // WRONG!!!
</div>
<p>
   The problem is that these properties aren't actually arrays.  What's
   <i>really</i> going on under the covers is that the language engine
   (Visual Basic or Javascript) has to make method calls to the OLE
   Automation object to read or write the properties.  Visual Basic
   hides that, by making it <i>look</i> like ordinary
   array access, but it isn't really; it's really a method call to the
   object.
</p>
<p>
   So how do we translate this to Javascript?  The <i>reading</i> part
   is easy: you just write it exactly like in Visual Basic:
</p>
<div class="code">
alert("The 'red' value is " + dict.Item("red"));
</div>
<p>
   The <i>writing</i> part is a little trickier.  Javascript doesn't
   let us use anything resembling the Visual Basic assignment syntax.
   Instead, we look to the C++ world, where Microsoft developed a
   naming convention to deal with the same mismatch.  Microsoft's
   convention for C++ is to create a method with the prefix <tt>put_</tt>
   followed by the property name.  This means "put a value in this
   property".  We do the same thing in Javascript.  Here's how you call it:
</p>
<div class="code">
dict.put_Item("red", 72);  // equivalent to VB's dict.Item("red") = 72
</div>
<p>
   The Javascript engine <i>automatically</i> creates a <tt>put_</tt> method
   for each Automation object property that requires parameters, so there's
   nothing extra you have to do to create these.  They're automatically present
   when necessary.  All you have to do is remember to call the method with the
   <tt>put_</tt> prefix when you want to assign to a property that takes
   arguments.
</p>
<p>
   To keep the syntax simple for the more common case of ordinary properties,
   a <tt>put_</tt> method is only created when a property takes extra arguments.
   Ordinary properties with no parameters can be both read and written using
   the original property name, as in the <tt>CompareMode</tt> property example
   at the start of this section.
</p>


<h2>OUT parameters</h2>

<p>
   Some automation object methods take "Out" parameters, which are
   arguments that the callee uses to return data to the caller.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript has no direct equivalent of "Out" parameters.
   The data transfer in Javascript is always one-way, from caller to callee.
   When calling an automation method that returns information through an "Out"
   parameter, therefore, we have to do something a little unusual.
</p>
<p>
   Specifically, we use <a href="Variant.html">Variant</a> objects.  If
   an automation method passes information back through an Out parameter,
   simply pass a Variant to the method for that parameter.  On return, the
   Variant will be modified to contain the returned information.
</p>
<div class="code">
let v = new Variant();
autoObj.FuncThatChangesArgument(v);

// v now contains the updated value
</div>

<p>
   The Javascript engine doesn't require Variants for OUT arguments; you
   can use any other value type instead.  But passing a Variant is the only
   way to retrieve the updated value if the callee changes the OUT
   parameter.  If you don't use a Variant, any update to the value will simply
   be discarded.
</p>
   
   

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
   <b>Unsupported types:</b>
   The Automation system doesn't currently support calling methods taking
   the parameter types listed below.  The parameter types are
   specified in the IDispatch COM interface provided by the automation
   object's native code, so this isn't a question of the argument values
   you pass from Javascript code; it's a fixed feature of each automation
   object's method interfaces.  Functions that require unsupported argument
   types will throw a Javascript error to that effect if you attempt to
   call them.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Arrays
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Event handling:</b>
   There's no built-in provision for the COM "event sink" system, which
   is used in some of the more complex automation objects to send asynchronous
   events back to the host program.  Objects with event callbacks
   therefore can't easily be used, or at least can't easily be used with
   their full event systems.
