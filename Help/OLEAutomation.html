<h1>OLE Automation Objects</h1>

<p>
   OLE Automation is a Windows feature that lets scripting languages
   access system functions and features in other applications.  This is also known
   as "Scripting Objects", but that's a vague term that can mean other
   things as well.  Automation was created originally for the Visual Basic
   language, and is most often used in VB.   Windows Power Users will be
   familiar with this from working with Visual Basic scripts in programs
   like Excel, Word, or WScript.  If you've done any work creating Visual
   Pinball tables, you might have used automation objects in VP's Visual Basic
   scripts.
</p>
<p>
   In Javascript, you create an OLE scripting object like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
let fs = createAutomationObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
</div>
<p>
   If you're a Visual Basic user, it might be helpful if we mention
   that this is the equivalent of VB's CreateObject() function.
</p>

<p>
   The object name in quotes is the "class name" of the object you wish
   to create.  This isn't defined by Javascript; it's defined by whatever
   application or system facility provides the automation object.  Windows
   provides a set of pre-installed "Scripting" objects, including
   "Scripting.FileSystemObject", which provides functions to access files
   and folders on the local hard disks.  Many other objects come from
   separate applications, such as Excel or Word. 
</p>
<p>
   If the named class is installed on your system, createAutomationObject()
   returns a Javascript object that provides the set of methods and properties
   defined by the system object.  You can now simply call methods on the
   returned object to access the system features provided by the object.
</p>
<div class="code">
// list the files in the Windows folder
for (let file of fs.GetSpecialFolder(0).Files)
    console.log(file.Name);
</div>

<p>
   One common Windows OLE object that you <i>shouldn't</i> use is
   MSXML.XMLHTTP (or any of its several versions).  You should use PinballY's
   <a href="HttpRequest.html">HttpRequest</a> instead, as it has provisions
   for asynchronous event handling that can't be easily reproduced with
   the generic Automation facility.
</p>

<h2>"Variant" arguments</h2>

<p>
   Many Automation objects work in terms of "Variant" variables, which
   is a special object formatted the same way that Visual Basic represents
   its variable values.  (Microsoft originally designed Automation around
   Visual Basic's needs, so the whole system is very VB-centric.)  When
   you call a method on an automation object, any Javascript arguments
   you pass to slots expecting Variant values have to be converted to
   Variant before being passed to the external object.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript will perform the conversion to Variant automatically if you
   use regular Javascript values as arguments, so in most cases you can just
   call methods on these objects without worrying about special data types.
</p>
<p>
   There's a snag, though.  The automatic conversion can't always figure out
   which type the callee expects, so it always uses a standard conversion
   from each Javascript type to a suitable corresponding Variant type.  For
   example, if you  pass a Javascript number value as an argument, it will
   always be converted to a Variant "double", which is the VB equivalent of
   a Javascript number.  The snag is that some automation methods are picky
   about the exact types they receive as arguments, and will return an
   error if you pass the "default" type used in the standard conversion
   from Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   In such cases, you can solve the mismatch by explicitly creating your
   own Variant variable, and setting it to the expected type.  You can do
   this as follows:
</p>
<div class="code">
// create a Variant variable and set its "short int" value
let v = new Variant();
v.iVal = 7;

// now pass "short int" 7 to an automation method
let x = createAutomationObject("Example.Object");
x.RequiresShortInt(v);
</div>


<p>
   See <a href="Variant.html">Variants</a> for details on the special
   Variant type.
</p>

<h2>OUT parameters</h2>

<p>
   Some automation object methods take "Out" parameters, which are
   arguments that the callee uses to return data to the caller.
</p>
<p>
   There's no direct equivalent of "Out" parameters in normal Javascript, as
   all arguments in Javascript function and method calls are passed by value.
   The data transfer in Javascript is always one-way, from caller to callee.
   When calling an automation method that returns information through an "Out"
   parameter, therefore, we have to do something a little unusual.
</p>
<p>
   Specifically, we use <a href="Variant.html">Variant</a> objects.  If
   an automation method passes information back through an Out parameter,
   simply pass a Variant to the method for that parameter.  On return, the
   Variant will be modified to contain the returned information.
</p>
<div class="code">
let v = new Variant();
autoObj.FuncThatChangesArgument(v);

// v now contains the updated value
</div>

<p>
   Note that you don't have to use a Variant for such arguments, but
   if you don't, any updated value will simply be discarded.  If
   you pass any other value type to a method taking an Out parameter,
   the value you specify will be sent to the callee as usual, using the
   normal type conversions, and any update to the value will be ignored.
</p>
   
   

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
   <b>Unsupported types:</b>
   The Automation system doesn't currently support calling methods taking
   the following VARIANT argument types.  The VARIANT argument types are
   specified in the IDispatch COM interface provided by the automation
   object's native code, so this isn't a question of the argument values
   you pass from Javascript code; it's a fixed feature of each automation
   object's method interfaces.  Functions that require unsupported argument
   types will throw a Javascript error to that effect if you attempt to
   call them.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Pointer ("by reference") types
   <li>Array types
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Event handling:</b>
   There's no built-in provision for the COM "event sink" system, which
   is used in some of the more complex automation objects to send asynchronous
   events back to the host program.  Objects with event callbacks
   therefore can't easily be used, or at least can't easily be used with
   their full event systems.
