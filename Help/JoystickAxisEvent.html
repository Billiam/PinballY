<h1>JoystickAxisEvent</h1>

<p>
   This Event subclass represents changes to joystick control axis
   values.  There are two subtypes of this event:
</p>
<ul>
   <a name="joystickaxischange"></a>
   <li><b>joystickaxischange:</b>  Fires when an axis value on the joystick
   changes while PinballY is in the foreground.

   <a name="joystickaxischangebg"></a>
   <li><b>joystickbuttonup:</b>  Fires when an axis value changes on the
   joystick while the program is in the foreground.
</ul>
<p>
   These events fire on the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY fires an axis change event each time any enabled axis
   on an enabled joystick changes its value.  The event object doesn't
   contain the updated axis values, however: for that, you have to
   use the axis reader methods in the <a href="JoystickInfo.html">JoystickInfo</a>
   object.  The usual way to code an axis event handler, therefore,
   is to obtain a JoystickInfo object up front, and then use that
   object in the event handler to read the axis values:
</p>
<div class="code">
let js = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(0);
js.enableAxisEvents({ axis: ["X", "Y"] });
mainWindow.on("joystickaxischange", ev =>
{
    // check that the event is for the unit I'm interested in
    if (ev.unit == js.unit)
    {
        // read the current axis values from the JoystickInfo
        let x = js.X();
        let y = js.Y();

        // do something with the new values here!
    }
});
</div>
<p>
   Note that more than one axis might be changed on each event.
   One Javascript event is fired for each update from the physical
   USB device in which one or more of the enabled axes have changed.
   The USB device can send changes to many axes at once, so one
   Javascript event might represent changes to several axes at
   the same time.  Each event is specific to a single joystick
   device, though - you'll get a separate event for each
   joystick that reports changes, each time it reports changes.
</p>


<h2>Axis events must be enabled explicitly</h2>
<p>
   Unlike most events, joystick axis change events must be specifically
   enabled.  PinballY doesn't send these events to your script unless
   you ask for them.  The reason is that we want to minimize performance
   overhead.  Most joysticks are designed to be very sensitive, so that
   minor vibrations or even normal thermal noise can trigger small
   changes to the position readings.  As a result, joysticks tend to
   send changes to the PC constantly.  If you have several joysticks
   connected, and PinballY generated Javascript events for every one
   of them every time any of their axis values changed, it could
   end up burning up a not-insignificant amount of CPU time
   processing those events.  If you don't have any scripts that care
   about those events, that would all be wasted work that would
   unnecessarily slow down PinballY and the rest of your system.
   So by default, PinballY just ignores all of those incoming
   joystick axis change updates.
</p>
<p>
   If you're writing a script that relies on monitoring a joystick
   axis, though, PinballY lets you enable the events you're
   interested in.  PinballY lets you be selective about this:
   you can enable events for specific axes of interest on
   individual joystick devices.  The program will continue
   to ignore all of the other joystick that you don't care about,
   so the performance impact will still be minimal.
</p>
<p>
   To enable events for a joystick,
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>
   to obtain a <a href="JoystickInfo.html">JoystickInfo</a> object for
   the joystick, and then call <a href="JoystickInfo.html#enableAxisEvents">enableAxisEvents</a>:
</p>
<div class="code">
// we'll assume that we already know which unit we're interested in
let js = mainWindow.getJoystickInfo(0);
js.enableAxisEvents();
</div>
<p>
   You can also enable axes on a joystick individually, by providing
   an object argument with the <b>axis</b> property set to the name
   of an axis to enable, or to an array of names:
</p>
<div class="code">
js.enableAxisEvents({ axis: ["X", "Y"] });
</div>
<p>
   By selectively enabling only the axes you're interested in,
   you'll reduce performance overhead by eliminating events
   that you don't care about.
</p>

<p>
   Don't let the explanation above deter you from using joystick
   events out of fear that they'll horribly bog down your system.
   It only takes about 50 microseconds for PinballY to handle a
   Javascript joystick event dispatch, and on most Windows systems,
   joystick updates happen about once every 10 milliseconds -
   so that's less than half a percent of overhead, which won't
   be at all noticeable.  The advantage of selectively enabling
   the events is that you'll still have <i>almost</i> no overhead
   from enabling events on one joystick, since the program will
   still filter out events from other joysticks.
</p>


<h2>"Axis" defined</h2>
<p>
   An "axis" represents one direction of motion of one
   of the moving controls on a joystick, such as the main stick,
   a wheel, a dial, or a slider.  Some controls, like dials and
   sliders, have only one dimension of motion - they can only
   move left/right or left/right or clockwise/counterclockwise.
   These controls only have one axis each, since you can
   describe their position with a single number saying where
   they are along that single dimension of motion.  The main stick,
   on the other hand, can usually move both left/right and forward/back,
   so it needs two axes to describe those two dimensions of motion.
   Even more axes might be needed for the main stick on more
   elaborate devices.  The stick might rotate, for example, in
   which case you need another axis for each rotational
   degree of freedom; and it might move up and down as well,
   requiring a "Z" axis for the vertical motion.  At any rate,
   as far as the computer is concerned, the joystick boils down
   to a collection of axes, each of which has a numeric value
   that indicates the current position of the control on
   that axis.
</p>
<p>
   The USB specifications lay out a list of all of the axis
   types that USB joysticks can have.  That allows game software
   to work with many types of joysticks without having to be
   programmed specially for each type, since the software can
   work in terms of the USB-spec abstractions without having
   to know anything more about every physical device.
</p>
<p>
   See the <a href="JoystickInfo.html">JoystickInfo</a> class
   for a list of the USB axis types that PinballY recognizes.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and
   methods (see the <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class), plus
   the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>background:</b> true if the application was in the
   background when the event occurred, false if not.

   <li><b>unit:</b> The "logical unit number" of the joystick that
   generated the event, representing which physical joystick had a
   change of axis values.  If multiple joysticks are attached to the
   system, this allows the program to distinguish which one generated
   the event.  The logical unit number isn't anything Windows knows
   about; it's just an internal ID assigned by PinballY to tell
   joysticks apart.  This value can be passed to
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#getJoystickInfo">mainWindow.getJoystickInfo()</a>
   to retrieve the device descriptor for the joystick.

</ul>      

<h2>Background events</h2>

<p>
   As with <a href="JoystickButtonKeyEvent.html">joystick button events</a>,
   there are separate axis change event types for events that occur
   when the program is in the foreground and background.  You can
   tell PinballY whether or not to enable background events at all
   when you enable axis events for the joystick.  By default, these
   events are only generated when PinballY is in the foreground,
   to minimize the performance impact while a game is running.
   However, if you do need the events even while PinballY is in
   the background, you can explicitly enable them.  See
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#enableJoystickAxisEvents">mainWindow.enableJoystickAxisEvents()</a>.
