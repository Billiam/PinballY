This folder is for custom PinballY media files.  You can place the
following items here:

Startup Video: Place a file called "Startup Video.mp4" here to show a
video each time PinballY first up.  (You can also use any of the other
supported video file formats in place of .mp4: .mpg, .f4v, .mkv, .wmv,
or .avi.)  If this file is present, PinballY will play it in the main
playfield window each time the program starts, then will show the
selected game as usual.

Startup Audio: Place a file called "Startup Audio.mp3" here to play an
audio track when PinballY starts up.  (You can make it a .wav or .ogg
file instead of .mp3, if you prefer.)  If you provide both a startup
audio track and a startup video, both files will play concurrently, so
you'll probably want to use a silent video and let the audio file
provide the soundtrack.
